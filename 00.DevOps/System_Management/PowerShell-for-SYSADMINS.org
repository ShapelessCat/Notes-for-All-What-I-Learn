  - The name PowerShell refers to two things:
    * A command line shell
    * A scripting language

  - Together they refer to one framework that can be used to automate everything.

  - In the first chapters of this book,
    1. you'll use the PowerShell console to become familiar with the basics of
       PowerShell.

    2. Once you've covered the basics, you'll graduate to more advanced topics
       including writing scripts, functions, and custom modules.

  - This chapter covers the basics:
    * some fundamental commands
    * how to find and read help pages
  
** DONE Opening the PowerShell Console - 4
   CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 02:28]
   - This book use PowerShell v5.1.

   - Newer versions have more features and bug fixes,
     BUT the basic syntax and core functionality of PowerShell _hasn't changed
     dramtically since version 2_.
   
** DONE Using DOS Commands - 4
   CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 02:53]
   You can use DOS commands, which are actually aliases to PowerShell commands.
   
   - *Using TAB Completion*
     * TAB:
       try to complete the command, and keep hitting TAB to move *forward* through
       possible commands.

     * SHIFT-TAB:
       like TAB, but move *backward*.
     
   - Alghough the majority do, not all commands in cmd.exe exist in PowerShell.
     Try to run ~Get-Alias~ for details.

** DONE Exploring PowerShell Commands - 6
   CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 03:23]
   - Like nearly all languages, PowerShell has /commands/, the _generic term_ for
     /named executable expressions/.

   - Run ~Get-Command~ to see a list of EVERY command PowerShell is aware of by default.

   - Most commands's names follow the same scheme: Verb-Noun.
     * To keep the language as intuitive as possible, Microsoft has set guidelines
       for command names.
         Alghough following this naming convention is _OPTIONAL_, it is _highly
       recommended_ for creating your own commands.

   - PowerShell commands come in a few flavors:
     * cmdlets
     * functions
     * aliases
     * external scripts

   - _MOST_ of the /built-in/ commands from Microsoft are /cmdlets/, which are
     typically commands written in other languages like C#.

   - By running the ~Get-Command~, you'll see a ~CommandType~ field in the output:
     #+begin_src powershell
       Get-Command -Name Get-Alias

       # CommandType    Name         Version    Source
       # -----------    ----         -------    ------
       # Cmdlet         Get-Alias    3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
     #+end_src

   - /Functions/ are /commands/ _written in PowerShell_.
     /Cmdlets/ and /functions/ are the *most common* command types you'll be
     working with in PowerShell.

   - You'll use the ~Get-Command~ command to explore the plethora of /cmdlets/ and
     /functions/ available in PowerShell.

   - A lot of /commands/ in PowerShell have /parameters/, which are values you
     give (or pass) to a command to customize its behavior.
     * For instance,
       ~Get-Command~ has various /parameters/ that allow you to return only
       specific commands instead of all of them.

   - The ~Get~ commands get information and the others modify information.
     
   - /Parameters/ of ~Get-Command~:
     * You can see that ~Get-Command~ allows you to separate out the verb and noun.
       + ~Verb~,
         limit that huge list of commands to only those that use certain verb like ~Get~:
         #+begin_src powershell
           Get-Command -Verb Get
         #+end_src

       + ~Noun~,
         combine with ~-Noun~
         #+begin_src powershell
           Get-Command -Noun Content
         #+end_src

       + Combine ~Verb~ and ~Noun~
         #+begin_src powershell
           Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun Content
         #+end_src

     * If you'd rather define the entire command as one unit, you can use the ~Name~
       parameter instead and specify the entire command name:
         #+begin_src powershell
           Get-Command -Name Get-Content
         #+end_src

   - You can learn a /command's parameters/ by using the robust _PowerShell help system_.
     
** DONE Getting Help - 8
   CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 04:15]
   In this section, you’ll learn
   - how to display command help pages in the prompt window,
   - get more general information on the language via About topics,
   - update your documentation with ~Update-Help~.

*** DONE Displaying the Docs - 8
    CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 03:58]
    Similar to the ~man~ /command/ in Linux, PowerShell has the ~help~ command and
    the ~Get-Help~ /cmdlet/.

    - If you're interested in seeing what one of those =Content= /cmdlets/ does,
      you can pass that command name to the ~Get-Help~ command to retrieve the
      standard =SYNOPSIS=, =SYNTAX=, =DESCRIPTION=, =RELATED LINKS=, and =REMARKS=
      help _sections_. Listing 1-7 displays the documentation for the ~Add-Content~
      /command/.
      #+begin_src powershell
        Get-Help Add-Content

        # NAME
        #     Add-Content
        #
        # SYNOPSIS
        #     Appends content, such as words or data, to a file.
        #
        # --snip--
      #+end_src
      * The most helpful part of this content is the ~Examples~ /parameter/.
        This /parameter/ shows examples of real-world uses of the /command/ in a
        variety of scenarios.
          Try ~Get-Help CommmandName -Examples~ on any /command/ and notice that
        nearly ALL /built-in commands/ have examples to help you understand what
        they do. For example,
        #+begin_src powershell
          Get-Help Add-Content -Examples

          # NAME
          #     Add-Content
          #
          # SYNOPSIS
          #     Appends content, such as words or data, to a file.
          #
          # -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
          #
          # C:\PS>Add-Content -Path *.txt -Exclude help* -Value "END"
          #
          # Description
          #
          # -----------
          #
          # This command adds "END" to all text files in the current directory,
          # except for those with file names that begin with "help."
          # --snip--
        #+end_src

    - If you want more information, the ~Get-Help~ /cmdlet/ also has the ~Detailed~ and
      ~Full~ /parameters/, which give you a complete rundown on what that /command/ does.

*** DONE Learning About General Topics - 9
    CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 04:15]
    - In addition to help content for individual commands, the PowerShell help
      system provides About topics, which are help snippets for broader subjects
      and specific commands. For example, in this chapter you’re learning about
      some of PowerShell’s core commands. Microsoft has created an About topic
      that gives an overall explanation of these commands. To see it, you run
      ~Get-Help about_Core_Commands~, as shown in Listing 1-9.

    - To get a complete list of all the About topics available, use a wildcard
      for the ~Name~ /parameter/. In PowerShell, the wildcard character, an asterisk
      (*), can be used as a placeholder for zero or more characters. You can use
      a wildcard with the ~Get-Help~ command's ~Name~ /parameter/, as in Listing 1-10.
      #+begin_src powershell
        Get-Help -Name About*
      #+end_src

    - By appending the wildcard to About, you’re asking PowerShell to search for
      all possible topics that start with About. If there are multiple matches,
      PowerShell will display a list, with brief information about each. To get
      the full information about one of the matches, you’ll have to pass it into
      ~Get-Help~ directly, as shown previously in Listing 1-9.

    - Although the Get-Help command has a ~Name~ /parameter/, you can pass the
      /parameter/ argument directly to it by entering -Name, as shown in Listing
      1-10. This is known as using a positional parameter, which determines the
      value you’re passing in based on its (you guessed it) position in the
      command. Positional parameters are a shortcut that many PowerShell
      commands have, allowing you to reduce the number of keystrokes.
    
** DONE Updating the Docs - 10
   CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 04:15]
   - The _help system_ in PowerShell is a great asset for anyone who wants to learn
     more about the language, but one key feature makes this _help system_ much
     better: *it's dynamic!*

     * Problem :: Documentation tends to get stale after a while. A product ships
       with documentation, bugs creep in, new features get released, but the
       documentation on the system stays the same.

     * PowerShell addresses this problem with updatable help, which allows the
       /built-in PowerShell cmdlets/ and ANY OTHER /cmdlets/ -- or /functions/
       built by others -- to point to an _internet URI_ in order to host up-to-date
       documentation.
       + Simply enter ~Update-Help~, and PowerShell will begin reading the help on
         your system and checking it against the various online locations.

   - Note that although updatable help is included with all /built-in PowerShell
     cmdlets/, it isn't required for any third-party commands.
     
   - Finally, you may occasionally receive an error when running ~Update-Help~ if
     the location where the help is stored is not available anymore.
       In short, don't expect ~Update-Help~ to always show the latest help
     content for every command in PowerShell.

   - *RUNNING POWERSHELL AS ADMINISTRATOR*
     In Start menu, right click Windows PowerShell and then clicking
     "Run as Administrator".

* TODO 2 BASIC POWERSHELL CONCEPTS - 13
  - This chapter covers _FOUR_ basic concepts in PowerShell:
    * variables
    * data types
    * objects
    * data structures

  - Those above mentioned concepts are fundamental to just about every common
    programming language,
    _BUT_ there's something that makes PowerShell distinctive: *EVERYTHING in
    PowerShell is an /object/.*
      
** DONE Variables - 13
   CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 03:37]
*** DONE Displaying and Changing a Variable - 14
    CLOSED: [2020-11-09 Mon 04:26]
    - ALL /variables/ in PowerShell START WITH a _dollar sign_ (~$~), which
      indicates to PowerShell that
      you are calling a /variable/ and *NOT* a /cmdlet/, /function/, /script
      file/, or /executable file/.
      * Example:
        #+begin_src powershell
          $MaximumHistoryCount
          # 4096

          $MaximumHistoryCount = 200
        #+end_src
        =from Jian=
        + CAUTION:
          Run this assignment in a PowerShell console doesn't automatically save
          the value to a persistent configuration file.

    - /Variables/ in PowerShell come in _TWO_ broad /classes/:
      * user-defined variables :: created by the user;
      * automatic variables :: already exist in PowerShell.

*** DONE User-Defined Variables - 14
    CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 02:18]
    A /variable/ needs to exist before you can use it.

    - If you can't see error messsages when you use a non-exist /variable/, you'd
      better turn on strict mode:
      #+begin_src powershell
        Set-StrictMode -Version Latest
      #+end_src
      =important= =!!!=

    - This BOOK:
      #+begin_src powershell
        $color
        # The variable '$color' cannot be retrieved because it has not been set.
        #
        # At line:1 char:1
        # + $color
        # + ~~~~
        # + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (color:String) [], RuntimeException
        # + FullyQualifiedErrorId : VariableIsUndefined
      #+end_src

    - Assignment with equal sign is equivalent to do with the ~Set-Variable~ command.
      Evaluate a /variable/ through ~$~ is equivalent to do with the ~Get-Variable~
      command.
      #+begin_src powershell
        Set-Variable -Name color -Value blue

        Get-Variable -Name color
        #
        # Name        Value
        # ----        -----
        # color       blue
      #+end_src
    
    - You can also use ~Get-Variable~ to return all available variables:
      #+begin_src powershell
        Get-Variable

        # Name    Value
        # ----    -----
        # $       Get-PSDrive
        # ?       True
        # ^       Get-PSDrive
        # args    {}
        # color   blue
        # --snip--
      #+end_src
      
*** DONE Automatic Variables - 16
    CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 03:37]
    - /Automatic variables/ are premade variables that PowerShell itself uses.
      * PowerShell *allows* you to _CHANGE_ SOME of these /variables/

      * I typically advise against it because unexpected consequences can arise.
        In general, you should *treat /automatic variables/ as _READ-ONLY_.*

    - This section covers a few of the /automatic variables/ that you're likely
      to use:
      * the ~$null~ variable
      * ~$LASTEXITCODE~
      * the /preference variables/.

**** DONE The ~$null~ Variable - 16
     CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 02:42]
     - Assign a ~$null~ to a /variable/ is like declare a /variable/ with a default
       empty initialization.
     
     - Evaluate this /variable/ in PowerShell, and nothing won't be printed out.
       Also there is no error for /variables/ that were never set.
     
**** DONE The ~LASTEXITCODE~ Variable - 17
     CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 02:55]
     ~LASTEXITCODE~ references the value of the LAST /exit code/, or /return code/
     of an /EXTERNAL applications/. Typically,
     - 0 indicates success
     - anything else means either a failure or another anomaly.
     
**** DONE The Preference Variables - 18
     CLOSED: [2020-11-10 Tue 03:37]
     - PowerShell has a type of /automatic variable/ referred to as /preference
       variables/. These variables control the _default behavior_ of various output
       streams:
       * ~Error~
       * ~Warning~
       * ~Verbose~
       * ~Debug~
       * ~Information~

     - *List* all of the /preference variables/ by running ~Get-Variable~
       and *filtering* for all variables ending in =Preference=, as shown here:
       #+begin_src powershell
         Get-Variable -Name *Preference

         # Name                     Value
         # ----                     -----
         # ConfirmPreference        High
         # DebugPreference          SilentlyContinue
         # ErrorActionPreference    Continue
         # InformationPreference    SilentlyContinue
         # ProgressPreference       Continue
         # VerbosePreference        SilentlyContinue
         # WarningPreference        Continue
         # WhatIfPreference         False
       #+end_src
       * These variables can be used to configure the various types of output
         PowerShell can return.
         For example, if you've ever made a mistake and seen that ugly red text,
         you've seen the ~Error~ output stream. Run the following command to
         generate an error message:
         #+begin_src powershell
           Get-Variable -Name 'doesnotexist'
           # Get-Variable : Cannot find a variable with the name 'doesnotexist'.
           # At line:1 char:1
           # + Get-Variable -Name 'doesnotexist'
           # + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           #     + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (doesnotexist:String) [Get-Variable],
           #                               ItemNotFoundException
           #     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : VariableNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetVariableCommand
         #+end_src

       * You should have gotten a similar error message, as this is the default
         behavior for the ~Error~ stream.

         If for whatever reason you didn't want to be bothered by this error
         text, and would rather nothing happen, you could redefine the
         ~$ErrorActionPreference~ variable to ~SilentlyContinue~ or ~Ignore~,
         either of which will tell PowerShell not to output any error text:
         #+begin_src powershell
           $ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
           Get-Variable -Name 'doesnotexist'
           # 
         #+end_src

       * For more information on /preference variables/, check out the ~about_help~
         content by running ~Get-Help about_Preference_Variables~.

*** DONE Boolean Values - 20
    CLOSED: [2020-11-14 Sat 02:58]
    In PowerShell, /booleans/ are called /bools/.

    - The _TWO_ /boolean values/ are represented by the /automatic variables/
      ~$true~ and ~$false~.

    - These /automatic variables/ are hardcoded into PowerShell and *can't be
      changed*.
    
    - Example:
      #+begin_src powershell
        $isOn = $true
        $isOne
        # True
      #+end_src
    
*** DONE Integers and Floating Points - 20
    CLOSED: [2020-11-14 Sat 03:36]
    Represent numbers in PowerShell in _two main ways_:
    - via /integer/
    - via /floating-point data types/
    
**** DONE Integer Types - 20
     CLOSED: [2020-11-14 Sat 03:22]
     - /Integer data types/ hold ONLY /whole numbers/ and will *round* any /decimal/
       input to the _nearest_ (=???=) /integer/. /Integer data types/ come in
       /signed and unsigned types/.

     - By default, PowerShell stores /integers/ by using the /32-bit signed ~Int32~
       type/.
       
     - ~Int32~: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

     - ~Int64~: –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
       * For numbers outside that range of ~Int32~, you can use the /64-bit signed
         ~Int64~ type/, which has a range of
       

     - Example (~Int32~ type):
       #+begin_src powershell
         $num = 1
         $num
         # 1

         $num.GetType().name
         # Int32

         $num = 1.5
         $num.GetType().name
         # Double

         [Int32]$num
         # 2
       #+end_src
       * You can see the /casting/ syntax, and it *rounds the value up*.

**** DONE Floating-Point Types - 21
     CLOSED: [2020-11-14 Sat 03:36]
     - The ~Double~ type belongs to the broader class of variables known as
       /floating-point variables/.
       * Although they can be used to represent /whole numbers/, /floating-point
         variables/ are most often used to represent /decimals/.

     - The other main /type/ of /floating-point variable/ is ~Float~.
       * This book won't go into the /internal representation/ of the ~Float~ and
         ~Double~ /types/.

     - Example:
       #+begin_src powershell
         $num = 0.1234567910
         $num.GetType().name
         # Double

         $num + $num
         # 0.2469135782

         [Float]$num + [Float]$num
         # 0.246913582086563
       #+end_src
       As you can see, PowerShell uses the ~Double~ /type/ _by default_.
       But notice what happens when you add ~$num~ to itself but *cast* both as a
       ~Float~ -- you get a strange answer.
       * Again, the reasons are beyond the scope of this book, but be aware that
         errors like this can happen when using ~Float~ and ~Double~.

     If a string is delimited by _double quotes_, /variable interpolations/, or
     /variable expansion/, can be done.
     
** TODO Objects - 23
   *In PowerShell, everything is an /object/.*

   - In technical terms, an /object/ is an individual instance of a specific
     template, called a /class/.

   - A /class/ specifies the kinds of things an /object/ will contain.

   - An /object/'s /class/ determines its /methods/, or /actions/ that can be
     taken on that /object/.
       Likewise, an /object/'s /class/ determines its /properties/, the /object's
     variables/.

*** TODO Inspecting Properties - 24
    First, let’s make a simple object so you can dissect it and uncover the
    various facets of a PowerShell object.
    #+begin_src powershell
      $color = 'red'
      $color
      # red
    #+end_src
    
    - Notice that when you call ~$color~, you get ONLY the _variable's value_.
      _BUT_ typically, because they're /objects/, /variables/ have MORE
      information than just their value.
      * They also have /properties/.

    - To look at an /object's properties/,
      you'll use _the ~Select-Object~ command_ and _the ~Property~ /parameter/._
      You'll pass the ~Property~ an /asterisk argument/, to tell PowerShell to
      return *everything* it finds.
      #+begin_src powershell
        Select-Object -InputObject $color -Property *

        # Length
        # ------
        #      3
      #+end_src
      * As you can see, the ~$color~ /string/ has *ONLY* a single /property/,
        called ~Length~.

      * You can directly reference the ~Length~ /property/ by using /dot notation/:
        ~$color.Length~

*** TODO Using the Get-Member cmdlet - 25
    Using Select-Object, you discovered that the $color string has only a single
    property. But recall that objects sometimes have methods as well. To take a
    look at all the methods and properties that exist on this string object, you can
    use the Get-Member cmdlet (Listing 2-20); this cmdlet will be your best friend
    for a long time. It’s an easy way to quickly list all of a particular object’s properties
    and methods, collectively referred to as an object’s members.
    
    - Example:
      #+begin_src powershell

      #+end_src
      Now we’re talking! It turns out that your simple string object has quite a
      few methods associated with it. There are lots more to explore, but not all
      are shown here. The number of methods and properties an object will have
      depends on its parent class.
    
*** TODO Calling Methods - 25
    You can reference methods with dot notation. However, unlike a property, a
    method will always end in a set of opening and closing parentheses and can
    take one or more parameters.
    
    - For example, suppose you want to remove a character in your ~$color~ variable.
      You can remove characters from a string by using the ~Remove()~ method.
      Let’s isolate /$color/'s ~Remove()~ method with the code in Listing 2-21.
      #+begin_src powershell
        Get-Member -InputObject $color –Name Remove
        # Name   MemberType Definition
        # ----   ---------- ----------
        # Remove Method     string Remove(int startIndex, int count), string Remove(int startIndex)
      #+end_src

    - As you can see, there are two definitions. This means you can use the method
      in two ways: either with ~startIndex~ and the ~count~ parameter, or with just
      ~startIndex~.

    - So to remove the second character in $color, you specify the place of the
      character where you’d like to start removing, which we call the index.
      Indexes start from 0, so the first letter has a starting place of 0, the
      second an index of 1, and so on. Along with an index, you can provide the
      number of characters you’d like to remove by using a comma to separate the
      parameter arguments, as in Listing 2-22.
      #+begin_src powershell
        $color.Remove(1, 1)
        # Rd

        $color
        # red
      #+end_src

    - Using an index of 1, you’ve told PowerShell that you want to remove
      characters starting with the string’s second character; the second argument
      tells PowerShell to remove just one character. So you get Rd. But notice that
      the Remove() method doesn’t permanently change the value of a string variable.
      If you’d like to keep this change, you’d need to assign the output of
      the Remove() method to a variable, as shown in Listing 2-23.
      #+begin_src powershell
        $newColor = $color.Remove(1,1)
        $newColor
        # Rd
      #+end_src

    - NOTE:
      If you need to know whether a method returns an object (as ~Remove()~ does)
      or modifies an existing object, you can check its description. As you can
      see in Listing 2-21, ~Remove()~'s definition has the word ~string~ in front
      of it; this means that the function returns a new string. Functions with the
      word ~void~ in front typically modify existing objects. Chapter 6 covers
      this topic in more depth.
