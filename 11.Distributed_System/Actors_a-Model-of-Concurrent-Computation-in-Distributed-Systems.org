* Chapter 1 Introduction
* Chapter 2 General Design Decisions
  - The FUNDAMENTAL _design decisions_ includes:
    (This list is by no means exhaustive but represents the aspects of a model
    of concurrent computation that we think are the most significant.)
    + the nature of the computing elements
    + global synchrony versus asynchronuous elements
    + the mode of interaction between computing elements
    + the degree of fairness
    + reconfigurability and extensibility

** 2.1 The Nature of Computing Elements - 6
   - The elements performing computations are, in an _abstract denotational sense_,
     some kind of _function_.

     + However, the domain and range of the functions defining the behavior of the
       elements is quite different in each of the models.

     + Ignoring some significant details, we identify _three_ distinct kinds of
       computational elements:
       1. Sequential Processes.
       2. Functions transforming data values.
       3. Actors.
