* Preface - ix
* 1. A Little Background - 1
** Introduction to Databases 1
   - /database/ :: nothing more than a set of related information.

   - /database system/ :: database with computerized data storage and retrieval mechanisms.

*** TODO Nonrelational Database Systems 2
*** TODO The Relational Model 4
    - /primary key/ :: The information (column(s)) of each table in a /relational
                       database/ that uniquely identifies a row in that table.

    - /compound key/ :: a primary key consisting of two or more columns.

    - /natural key/ and /surrogate key/
      The decision whether to employ natural or surrogate key is a topic of
      widespread debate.

    - /primary key/ columns should never be allowed to change once a value has
      been assigned.

      Since a person's name can change, we won't use the =fname/lname= as the
      primary key here.

    - =TODO= page 6

    - _not proper_: a single column to contain multiple pieces of information,
      such as
      + a name column that contains both a person's first and last names,
        or
      + an address column that contains street, city, state, and zip code
        information.

    - The process of refining a database design to ensure that each independent
      piece of information is in only one place (except for =TODO= /foreign keys/) is
      known as /normalization/.

*** TODO Some Terminology 6
    - Entity :: Something of interest to the database user community. Examples
                include customers, parts, geographic locations, etc.

    - Column :: An individual piece of data stored in a table.

    - Row :: A set of columns that together completely describe an entity or some
             action on an entity. Also called a record.

    - Table :: A set of rows, held either in memory (nonpersistent) or on
               permanent storage (persistent).

    - Result :: set Another name for a nonpersistent table, generally the result
                of an SQL query.

    - Primary key :: One or more columns that can be used as a unique identifier
                     for each row in a table.

    - Foreign key :: One or more columns that can be used together to identify a
                     single row in another table.
