   - In the digital world, databases are classified by how they organize and
     store their data. Some common types of digital databases are:
     + Flat file databases

     + Hierarchical databases

     + Key-value/document-oriented databases

     + Relational databases

   - /Database servers/ sit above digital /databases/.

   - We never work directly with databases:
     1. We send requests

     2. Database perform the required operations

   - This book focuses on MySQL, a /database server/ that manages relational
     databases.

   - Since the mid 1980s, /Structured Query Language (SQL)/ has been the standard
     language used to communicate with /relational database management systems/.

   - SQL statements can be divided into categories or "sub-languages" based on
     their purpose (this book will talke about MySQL as a whole, and it won't
     make fine disinctions like the ones listed below):
     + Data Manipulation Language (DML) ::
          Statements those pertaining to data *storage* and *retrieval*.

     + Data Definition Language (DDL) ::
          Statements those for *table* and *database* _management_.

     + Data Control Language (DCL) ::
          Statements those that *grant* or *revoke* access to the database.

** TODO From Codd to MySQL, a Brief History - xiii
   - Edgar Codd's idea in 1970 in his paper
     *A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks*.

   - IBM Create System R to verify Edgar Codd's idea.

   - Larry Ellison heard the reaserch of System R and Codd's idea.
     He incorporated Codd's ideas into his own database server, Oracle.

   - UC Berkeley team led by Michael Stonebrakerwork on University INGRES.
     INGRES explored many of Codd's relational ideas, but also implemented _its
     own_ query language called /QUEL/.

   - A INGRES clone /Sybase/ was later licensed to Microsoft and rebranded as
     Microsoft SQL Server.

   - INGRES itself was commercialized and quickly became a market leader.
     However, INGRES's position of dominance started to decline 1985 when the
     public sentiment shifted in favor of SQL over QUEL.

     SQL was accepted as the standard by ANSI and IOS by 1987.

   - David Hughes
     Postgres (a successor of INGRES) -> miniSQL.
     The first low-cost database server.

   - Monty Widenius
     MySQL.

   - MySQL was made available under the GPL.

   - For some reasons, MySQL take the place of miniSQL
     + GPL license and
       later alternative licensing and support for commercial customers.
       
     + its API was compatible with miniSQL but made more features available.
       
   - Today, /MySQL/ is the *second* most popular /SQL RDBMS/

     Thanks in large part to its use in smartphones and embedded software,
     /SQLite/ is *the number one*.
