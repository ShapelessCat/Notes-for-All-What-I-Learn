** What Is This Thing Called Polars?
Polars is a high-performance data processing package designed for efficient
handling of large-scale datasets. What started as a side project by Ritchie Vink
to learn Rust and to better understand data processing has now grown into a
popular package. Data scientists, data engineers, and software developers use it
to perform data analysis, create data visualizations, and build data-intensive
applications used in production.
