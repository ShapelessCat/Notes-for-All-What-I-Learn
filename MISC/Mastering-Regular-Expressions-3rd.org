* Preface
  - =from Jian=
    In an ideal world of programming, most of the data are structured, and we
    don't need to frequently use /regular expressions/.
    However, in this is not the case in the real world!

  - To master /regular expressions/ is to master your (=from Jian= un-structured)
    data.

** DONE How to Read This book
   CLOSED: [2020-11-08 Sun 22:30]
   This book is part tutorial, part reference manual, and part story, depending on
   when you use it.
   
   - It is not recommended to use this book as a reference before reading Chapter
     1 ~ 6, which are important.
   
** TODO Organization
   The ten chapters of this book can be logically divided into roughly three parts.

   - Here's a quick overview:
     * The Introduction
       + Chapter 1 introduces the concept of regular expressions.
       + Chapter 2 takes a look at text processing with regular expressions.
       + Chapter 3 provides an overview of features and utilities, plus a bit of history.

     * The Details
       + Chapter 4 explains the details of how regular expressions work.
       + Chapter 5 works through examples, using the knowledge from Chapter 4.
       + Chapter 6 discusses efficiency in detail.
         
     * Tool-Specific Information
       + Chapter 7 covers Perl regular expressions in detail.
       + Chapter 8 looks at Sun's java.util.regex package.
       + Chapter 9 looks at .NET's language-neutral regular-expr ession package.
       + Chapter 10 looks at PHP's preg suite of regex functions.

   - The introduction elevates the absolute novice to "issue-aware" novice.
     (1) Readers with a fair amount of experience can feel free to skim the early chapters,
     (2) BUT *I particularly recommend _Chapter 3_ even for the grizzled expert.*
     * _Chapter 1, Introduction to Regular Expressions_,
       is geared toward the complete novice.
       1. I introduce the concept of /regular expressions/ using the widely available
          program ~egrep~,
       2. offer my perspective on how to think /regular expressions/,
       3. instilling a solid foundation for the advanced concepts presented in
          later chapters.

     * _Chapter 2, Extended Introductory Examples_,
       looks at real text processing in a programming language that has
       regular-expression support.
       
       + The additional examples provide a basis for the detailed discussions of
         later chapters, and show additional important thought processes behind
         crafting advanced regular expressions.

       + To provide a feel for how to "speak in regular expressions," this chapter
         takes a problem requiring an advanced solution and shows ways to solve
         it using two unrelated regular-expression-wielding tools.

     * _Chapter 3, Overview of Regular Expression Features and Flavors_,
       provides an overview of the wide range of /regular expressions/ commonly
       found in tools today.
       
       + Due to their turbulent history, current commonly-used regular-expression
         flavors can differ greatly.
       
       + This chapter also takes a look at a bit of the history and evolution of
         regular expressions and the programs that use them.
       
       + The end of this chapter also contains the "Guide to the Advanced Chapters."
         This guide is your road map to getting the most out of the advanced
         material that follows.
   
*** TODO The Details
    Once you have the basics down, it's time to investigate the how and the why.
    Like the "teach a man to fish" parable, truly understanding the issues will
    allow you to apply that knowledge whenever and wherever regular expressions
    are found.
    - Chapter 4, The Mechanics of Expression Processing, ratchets up the pace several
      notches and begins the central core of this book. It looks at the important
      inner workings of how regular expression engines really work from a practical
      point of view. Understanding the details of how regular expressions are
      handled goes a very long way toward allowing you to master them.

    - Chapter 5, Practical Regex Techniques, then puts that knowledge to high-level,
      practical use. Common (but complex) problems are explor ed in detail, all with
      the aim of expanding and deepening your regular-expr ession experience.

    - Chapter 6, Crafting an Efficient Expression, looks at the real-life efficiency
      ramifications of the regular expressions available to most programming
      languages. This chapter puts information detailed in Chapters 4 and 5 to
      use for exploiting an engine's strengths and stepping around its
      weaknesses.

*** TODO Tool-Specific Information
    Once the lessons of Chapters 4, 5, and 6 are under your belt, there is
    usually little to say about specific implementations. However, I've
    devoted an entire chapter to each of four popular systems:
    - Chapter 7, Perl, closely examines regular expressions in Perl, arguably the
      most popular regular-expression -- laden pr ogramming language in use today.
      It has only four operators related to regular expressions, but their myriad
      of options and special situations provides an extremely rich set of programming
      options -- and pitfalls. The very richness that allows the programmer to move
      quickly from concept to program can be a minefield for the uninitiated.
      This detailed chapter clears a path.

    - Chapter 8, Java, looks in detail at the java.util.regex regular-expr ession
      package, a standard part of the language since Java 1.4. The chapter's primary
      focus is on Java 1.5, but differ ences in both Java 1.4.2 and Java 1.6 are noted.
      
    - Chapter 9, .NET, is the documentation for the .NET regular-expr ession library
      that Microsoft neglected to provide. Whether using VB.NET, C#, C++, JScript,
      VBscript, ECMAScript, or any of the other languages that use .NET components,
      this chapter provides the details you need to employ .NET regular-expr essions
      to the fullest.
      
    - Chapter 10, PHP, provides a short introduction to the multiple regex engines
      embedded within PHP, followed by a detailed look at the regex flavor and API
      of its preg regex suite, powered under the hood by the PCRE regex library.

* TODO 1 Introduction to Regular Expressions
  - Here's the scenario: you're given the job of checking the pages on a web server
    for doubled words (such as "this this"), a common problem with documents subject
    to heavy editing. Your job is to create a solution that will:
    * Accept any number of files to check, report each line of each file that has
      doubled words, highlight (using standard ANSI escape sequences) each doubled
      word, and ensure that the source filename appears with each line in the
      report.
      
    * Work across lines, even finding situations where a word at the end of one
      line is repeated at the beginning of the next.

    * Find doubled words despite capitalization differ ences, such as with
      'The the...', as well as allow differing amounts of whitespace (spaces,
      tabs, newlines, and the like) to lie between the words.

    * Find doubled words even when separated by HTML tags. HTML tags are for marking
      up text on World Wide Web pages, for example, to make a word bold:
      '...it is <B>very</B> very important...'.

  - That's certainly a tall order! But, it's a real problem that needs to be solved.
    At one point while working on the manuscript for this book, I ran such a
    tool on what I'd written so far and was surprised at the way numerous
    doubled words had crept in. Ther e ar e many programming languages one could
    use to solve the problem, but one with regular expression support can make
    the job substantially easier.

  - Regular expressions ar e the key to powerful, flexible, and efficient text
    processing. Regular expressions themselves, with a general pattern notation
    almost like a mini pr ogramming language, allow you to describe and parse text.
    With additional support provided by the particular tool being used, regular
    expressions can add, remove, isolate, and generally fold, spindle, and mutilate
    all kinds of text and data.

  - It might be as simple as a text editor's search command or as powerful as a full
    text processing language. This book shows you the many ways regular expressions
    can increase your productivity. It teaches you how to think regular expressions
    so that you can master them, taking advantage of the full magnitude of their power.

  - A full program that solves the doubled-word problem can be implemented in just
    a few lines of many of today's popular languages. With a single regular-expression
    search-and-r eplace command, you can find and highlight doubled words in the
    document. With another, you can remove all lines without doubled words (leaving
    only the lines of interest left to report). Finally, with a third, you can ensure
    that each line to be displayed begins with the name of the file the line came from.
    We'll see examples in Perl and Java in the next chapter.

  - The host language (Perl, Java, VB.NET, or whatever) provides the peripheral
    processing support, but the real power comes from regular expressions. In
    harnessing this power for your own needs, you learn how to write regular
    expressions to identify text you want, while bypassing text you don't. You
    can then combine your expr essions with the language's support constructs to
    actually do something with the text (add appropriate highlighting codes,
    remove the text, change the text, and so on).

  - Java has had a native regex package, ~java.util.regex~,
    since the early-2002 release of Java 1.4.0.
    + It has fairly good Unicode support
    + =TODO= It matches against ~CharSequence~ objects, so it can be quite
      flexible in its application.

  - Officially, this book covers Java 1.5.0.

    Important differences from Java 1.4.2 and the second 1.6 beta will be
    indicated.
    (=TODO= The differences are also summarized at the end of this chapter)
