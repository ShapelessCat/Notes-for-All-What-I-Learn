* Acknowledgments - vii
* TODO Preface - ix
- In this book,
  * you'll
    1. configure,
    2. use, and
    3. customize
    tmux.

  * You'll
    + manage multiple programs simultaneously,
    + write scripts to create custom environments, and
    + use tmux to work remotely with others.

 - With tmux, you can create a work environment that keeps almost everything you
   need at your fingertips.

** TODO What Is tmux? - =TODO= _Take notes_
*tmux* is a /terminal multiplexer/.

** DONE Who Should Read This Book
CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 23:40]
_System administrators_ or _software developers_
who *spend a good part of your time using the terminal and command-line tools,*
this book aims to help you work faster.

- If you're a _software developer_, =TODO=
  * you'll use tmux to build a development environment that can make working
    with multiple terminal sessions a breeze.
  * And if you're already comfortable using Vim or Emacs,
    you'll see how tmux can accelerate your workflow even more.

- If you're a system administrator or a developer who spends time *working with
  remote servers*, =TODO=
  you'll be interested in
  * HOW you can leverage tmux to create a persistent dashboard for managing or
    monitoring servers.

** What's in This Book
** Changes in the Third Edition
=from Jian=
Since I didn't read the previous version, the only useful for me is that this
edition require *at least tmux 3.4*.

** DONE What You'll Need
CLOSED: [2025-06-24 Tue 23:51]
- Require *nix-compatible system.

- While not required, some experience with text editors such as Vim or Emacs
  might be helpful. tmux works in much the same way.
