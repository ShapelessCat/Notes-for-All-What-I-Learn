  - /working directory/

  - This module explores the fundamental Git workflow:
    + Step 1. creating a repository,
    + Step 2. staging and commiting snapshots
    + Step 3. configuring options, and
    + Step 4. viewing the state of a repository.

** DONE Create the Example Site
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:06]
   - Create a new folder called =my-git-repo= for our project as a repository.

** DONE Initialize the Git Repository
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:09]
   - ~git init~
      The =.git= folder is the only difference between a Git repository and an
      ordinary folder.

** DONE View the Repository Status
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:10]
   - ~git status~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       On branch master

       Initial commit

       Untracked files:
         (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

               index.html

       nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
     #+END_SRC

     =TODO= =On branch master= explain later.

   - /untracked file/

** DONE Stage a Snapshot
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:23]
   - Step 1. ~git add index.html~

   - Step 2. ~git status~ again and you can see:
      #+BEGIN_SRC text
        On branch master

        Initial commit

        Changes to be committed:
          (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

                new file:   index.html
      #+END_SRC

   - /snapshot/ represents the state of your project at a given point in time.

     In this case, we create a snapshot with one file: =index.html=.

     If we ever told Git to revert to this /snapshot/, it would replace the
     entire project folder with the one file, containing the exact same HTML as
     it does right now.

   - /staging/ is a term of Git used to represent "creating a snapshot".

     Use this word because we can add or remove multiple files before actually
     commiting it to the project history. Staging gives us _the opportunity to
     group related changes into distinct snapshots_ -- a practice that makes it
     possible to track the meaningful progression of a software project (instead
     of just arbitrary lines of code).

     For example, six files are changed, and they should belong to two meaningful
     changes. We can ~add~ the first three, ~commit~ (next section) the
     /snapshot/, and ~add~ the other three, ~commit~ another /snapshot/ ----
     different stages.

** DONE Commit the Snapshot
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:37]
   - The ~commit~'s between each /snapshot/'s is required.
     Without a ~commit~ and ~add~ multiple times actually means _NO staging_.

     ~add~ won't ~commit~ automatically, and the no-commit intermediate
     /snapshot/'s acutally DO NOT exist ---- you can imagine a them, but without
     ~commit~'s they won't show up in history, for the other people the
     /snapshot/'s in your mind never exist.

     From this point of view, I have to say one /staging/ acutally implies that
     there is one ~commit~ after it. A ~commit~ guarantees the /staging/ before
     will be recorded in the history.

   - ~git commit~
     Without the ~-m <message>~ part, this command will open a text editor and
     prompt you to enter a message for the commit.
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       [master (root-commit) eca657e] Create index page
        1 file changed, 15 insertions(+)
        create mode 100755 index.html
     #+END_SRC

     + /root-commit/

   - Now you know, saving a version of your project (a /snapshot/) is a two step
     process:
     1. /Staging/: Telling Git what files to include in the next commit.
     2. /Committing/: Recording the staged snapshot with a descriptive message.

** DONE View the Repository History
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:45]
   - ~git log~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       commit eca657ec851744863f04cdb07365726e29788653
       Author: lanjiann <lanjiann1985@gmail.com>
       Date:   Sun Jul 9 04:40:07 2017 -0600

           Create index page
     #+END_SRC
     The random-looking string after =commit= above is an _SHA-1 checksum_ of the
     commit's contents, which ensures that the commit will never be corrupted
     without Git knowing about it. =TODO=

** DONE Configure Git
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:45]
   - ~git config --global user.name "Your Name"~
   - ~git config --global user.email your.email@example.com~
** DONE Create New HTML Files
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:50]
   Create =orange.html= and =blue.html=
** DONE Stage the New Files
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 04:53]
   - Step 1.
     ~git add orange.html blue.html~

   - Now ~git status~ can show you /staged changes/, but you won't see them in
     the output of ~git log~ before you ~commit~.

** DONE Commit the New Files
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 05:01]
** DONE Modify the HTML Pages
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 05:01]
   - ~add~ command can stage both _new_ files and _modified_ files.
** DONE Stage and Commit the Snapshot
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 05:02]
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git status
     git add index.html orange.html blue.html
     git status
     git commit -m "Add navigation links"

   #+END_SRC
** DONE Explore the Repository
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 05:06]
   - ~git log --oneline~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       91093ac Add navigation links
       505d596 Create blue and orange pages
       eca657e Create index page
     #+END_SRC

   - ~git log --oneline blue.html~
     Only inspect the history =blue.html=.
     You can see the "Create index page" commit in this command output.
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       91093ac Add navigation links
       505d596 Create blue and orange pages
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Conclusion
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 05:09]
   - /working directory/, /staged snapshot/, /committed snaptshot(s)/ are the
     core concepts of Git version control.
       Nearly all other Git commands manipulate one of these components in some
     way.

** DONE Quick Reference
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 05:10]
   - ~git init~

   - ~git status~

   - ~git add <file(s)>~

   - ~git commit~

   - ~git log~

   - ~git config --global user.name "<name>"~

   - ~git config --global user.email "<email>"~

* DONE Undoing Changes
  CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 22:46]
** DONE Display Commit Checksums
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 17:43]
   - ~git log --oneline~ only prints out the first 7 characters of the checksum.
** DONE View an Old Revision
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 18:15]
   - Suppose that the output of your ~git log --oneline~ is
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       1c310d2 Add navigation links
       54650a3 Create blue and orange pages
       b650e4b Create index page
     #+END_SRC

   - ~git checkout 54650a3~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       Note: checking out '54650a3'.

       You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
       changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
       state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

       If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
       do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

         git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

       HEAD is now at 54650a3... Create blue and orange pages
     #+END_SRC

   - The _navigation links_ we added in the third commit have _disappeared_.

   - =TOOD= /detached HEAD/

** DONE View an Older Revision
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 18:19]
   - ~git checkout b650e4b~
     Now, the =blue.html= and =orange.html= files are gone.

   - ~git status~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       HEAD detached at b650e4b
       nothing to commit, working directory clean
     #+END_SRC

     Compare this to our newest snapshot:
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       On branch master
       nothing to commit, working directory clean
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Return to Current Revision
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 18:21]
   - ~git checkout master~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       Previous HEAD position was b650e4b... Create index page
       Switched to branch 'master'
     #+END_SRC
** DONE Tag a Release
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 18:31]
   - We can all the newest snapshot of our project a stable version of the
     example website.
       We can make it official by /tagging/ the most recent commit with a version
     number: ~git tag -a v1.0 -m "Stable version of the website"~

   - _Tags_ are convenient references to
     + official releases
       and
     + other significant milestones.

     You can use the tag =v1.0= to refer to the third commit instead of its
     random ID -- this lets developers easily browse and check out important
     revisions.

   - Use ~git tag~ without any arguments to list all existing tags.

   - /annotated tag/: in the above snippet, the ~-a~ flag tells Git to create an
     /annotated tag/, which lets us record our name, the date, and a descriptive
     message (specified via the ~-m~ flag).

   - We'll use this tag to find the stable version after we try some crazy
     experiments.

** DONE Try a Crazy Experiment
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 18:32]
   Create a new file called =crazy.html= and add the following HTML.
** DONE Stage and Commit the Snapshot
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 18:44]
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git add crazy.html
     git status
     git commit -m "Add a crazzzy experiment"
     git log
   #+END_SRC

   - It's a good practice to run ~git status~ to see exactly what you're
     committing before running ~git commit -m~, which can help you to avoid
     unintentionally committing a file that doesn't belong in the current
     snapshot.

   - If the log history takes up more than one screen, you can scroll down by
     pressing =Space= (=From Jian= Or try vim' =j= and =k=) and return to the
     command line by pressing the letter =q=.

** DONE View the Stable Commit
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 18:50]
   - Got back and take a look at our stable revision.
     ~git checkout v1.0~

   - Now we decide to scrap the crazy experiment.
     But, before we undo the changes, we need to return to the ~master~ branch
     (we are in the ~v1.0~). If we did NOT, all of our updates would be on some
     non-existent branch.

     =IMPORTANT= As we'll discover next module, you should never make changes
     directly to a previous revision.

   - ~git checkout master~
     ~git log --oneline~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       514fbe7 Add a crazzzy experiment
       1c310d2 Add navigation links
       54650a3 Create blue and orange pages
       b650e4b Create index page
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Undo Committed Changes
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 18:59]
   - ~git revert 514fbe7~
     A file will pop out and prompt you to add some commit message.
     There is a default message, for this case it is
     ~Revert "Add a crazzzy experiment"~. This is OK.

   - ~git status~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       506bb9b Revert "Add a crazzzy experiment"
       514fbe7 Add a crazzzy experiment
       1c310d2 Add navigation links
       54650a3 Create blue and orange pages
       b650e4b Create index page
     #+END_SRC

     Git is designed to never lose history.
     (=TODO= except when you are on purpose, but this is NOT the point of design
     -- this is only the flexibility of design).
     The forth commit is still there, though files in that snapshot have the same
     content as the newest commit -- just in case we want to continue developing
     it.

** DONE Start a Smaller Experiment
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 22:06]
   - Create =dummy.html= and leave it as a blank file.
     Then, add a link in the "Navigation" section of =index.html=.

   - Now we want to abandon thi uncommitted experiment.
     Since the ~git revert~ command requires a commit ID to _undo_, we can't use
     the method discussed above.

** DONE Undo Uncommitted Changes
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 22:21]
   - ~git status~
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       On branch master
       Changes not staged for commit:
         (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
         (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

               modified:   index.html

       Untracked files:
         (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

               dummy.html

       no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
     #+END_SRC

   - First, let's take care the _tracked_ and _modified_ file =index.html=

     ~git reset --hard~
     The output is =HEAD is now a 506bb9b Revert "Add a crazzzy experiment"=

     + The above command changes _all tracked_ files to match the most recent commit.

       ~--hard~ flag of ~reset~ is what _actually_ updates the file.

       Running ~git reset~ without any flags will simply unstage =index.html=,
       leaving its contents as is.

     + ~git rest~ ONLY operates on
       * the working directory
         and
       * the staging area
       
       , so ~git log~ history remains unchanged.

   - Second, let's remove the =dummy.html= file.

     Use Git command to eliminates human errors, especially for the future
     several files operation. Thus, please do NOT manually remove it.

     Use command ~git clean -f~
     This will remove all /untracked/ files.

     After this step,
     NO modified tracked files (due to ~git reset --hard~) and
     NO untracked files (due to ~git clean -f~).

   - _BE CAREFUL_
     Both ~git reset~ and ~git clean~ operate on the working directory,
     NOT on the committed snapshots.

     Unlike ~git revert~, they permanently undo changes (you can't find them back
     through Git), so make sure you really want to trash what you're working on
     before you use them.

** DONE Conclusion
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 22:40]
   - Most Git commands operate on one of the THREE main components of a Git
     repository:
     + the working directory
     + the staged snapshot
     + the committed snapshots

   - The ~git reset~ command undoes changes to the working directory and the
     staged snapshot,
     while ~git revert~ undoes changes contained in committed snapshots.

     Not surprisingly, ~git status~ and ~git log~ directly parallel this
     behavior.

   - ~git revert~ saves the commit and create a new commit, rather than remove
     this commit. We now have two reasons:
     + In case you want to come back to it later

     + When we start working with remote repositories, we'll see that altering
       the history by removing a commit has _dramatic consequences_ for
       collaborating with other developers.

* DONE Branches I
  CLOSED: [2017-07-10 Mon 03:04]
  - FOUR core elements to work with throughout the rest of this tutorial:
    + The Working Directory
    + The Staged Snapshot
    + Committed Snapshots
    + Development Branches

  - In Git, a /branch/ is an independent line of development.
    + Branches present an error-proof method for incorporating changes from the
      experiment.

    + Branches let you store all of your experiments in a single directory, which
      makes it much easier to keep track of them and to share them with others.

    + =TODO= Branches also lend themselves to several standardized workflows for
      both individual and collaborative development, which will be explored in
      the latter half of the tutorial.

** DONE View Existing Branches
   CLOSED: [2017-07-09 Sun 23:29]
   ~git branch~
   output: ~* mater~

   - The ~master~ branch is Git's default branch.

   - The asterisk (~*~) next to it tells us that it's currently checked out.

   - There is
     ONLY ONE /working directory/ for each project,
     ONLY ONE /branch/ can be checked out at a time.

** DONE Checkout the Crazy Experiment

   Git WON'T re-create the commits in ~css~ branch and add them to the

   tip of ~master~ to match the tip of ~css~.
   _This kind of merge is called a /fast-forward merge/.

   After this merge, both branches (~master~ and ~css~) have the _exact same
   history_, which makes them redundant.

  - Instead of introducing new commands, this module covers
    + how the typical Git user applies this workflow to real projects,
      as well as
    + some of the problems that arise in a branched environment.

  - It's often useful to assign special meaning to different branches.

  - /topic branches/: temporary branches that exist to develop a certain topic,
    later they will be deleted (usually, after merging).

  - =TODO= We'll work with two types of topic branches later in this module.

  - =TODO= Some merges cannot be "fast-forworded".

  - When the history of two branches diverges, a dedicated commit is required to
    combine the branches.
      This situation may also give rise to a merge conflict, which _must be
    manually resolved_ before anything can be committed to the repository.

   When you ~merge~, an editor will be open and prompt you for a message
   explaining why the commit was necessary.
     The default one that is already in the file is:

   NO fast-forwarded tip. Both branches have their own unique changes.

   - /3-way-merge/: it occurs when you try to merge two branches whose history
     has diverged. It creates an extra /merge commit/ to function as a link
     between the two branches.

     Git looks at three commits (numbered in the above figure)

     1. the start of the fork of this branch
     2. the tip of the first branch
     3. the tip of the second branch

   - After the /rebase/, =about= is a linear extension of the master branch,
     enabling us to do a fast-forward merge later on.

     /Rebasing/ also allowed us to integrate the most up-to-date version of

   Thanks to the /rebase/, ~about~ rests on top of ~master~.

   All of our ~about~ section commits are gouped together,
   + which would NOT be the case had we merged instead of rebased.
   + This also eliminates an unnecessary fork in our project history.

   Once anain, the next two snapshots are unnecessarily trivial.
   HOWEVER, _we'll use an INTERACTIVE rebase to combine them into a single
   commit later on_ -- ~git rabase~ NOT only lets you move branches around, it
   enables you to manipulate individual commits as you do so.

** DONE Clean Up the Commit History
   CLOSED: [2017-07-12 Wed 21:26]
   Before ~merge~ into the ~master~ branch,
   we should make sure we have a clean, meaningful history in our feature branch.

   _By rebasing interactively_, we can choose _how_ each ~commit~ is transferred
   to the new base.

   Specify an _interactive_ ~rebase~ by passing the =-i= flag to the ~rebase~
   command: ~git rebase -i master~

   - The first opened file ask you to do something to the ~rebase~ related
     commits. You can change "pick" to "squash" according to the book.

   - After you close and save the file above, some files come out to prompt you
     to make decision of how to change the commit messages of _combined commits_.

   Interactive rebasing gives you _complete control_ over your project history,
   but this can also very _dangerous_.
     For exmaple, if you _delete a line from the rebase listing_,
   the associated commit wouldn't be transferred to the new base, and its
   content would be _lost forever_.

   =TODO= In a future module, we’ll also see how rewriting history can get you in
   trouble with public Git repositories

** DONE Stop to Amend a Commit
   CLOSED: [2017-07-12 Wed 21:57]
   ~git rebase -i master~

   Then we can see three commits, change the middle one to "edit".
   Add a message to the blank =about/mary.html= file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git add about/mary.html
     git status
     git commit --amend

   #+END_SRC

   If you ever find yourself lost in the middle of a ~rebase~ and you're afraid
   to continue, you can use the ~--abort~ flag to abandon it and start over from
   scratch.

** DONE Publish the About Section
   CLOSED: [2017-07-12 Wed 22:02]

   CLOSED: [2017-07-13 Thu 00:22]
   Git uses the /tip/ of a branch to represent the _entire branch_.
   That is to say, a branch is actually a pointer to a single commit -- NOT a
   container for a series of commits. For this point of view we know:

   + The history is represented by the parent of each commit (designated by
     arrows), NOT the branch itself.

   ~--bare~ flag is used to tell Git that we don't want a working directory.
   This will prevent us from developing in the central repository, which
   eliminates the possibility of messing up another user's environment with
   ~git push~.

   A central repository is only supposed to act as a /storage facility/ -- NOT
   a development environment.

   The =central-repo.git= folder contains the exact same files as the =.git=
   folder in our =my-git-repo= project. Git has literally gotten rid of our
   working directory. The conventional =.git= extension in the directory name is

   Before Mary considers pushing her updates to the central repository, she
   needs to make sure she has a clean history. This must be done by Mary,
   because it's near-impossible to change history after it has been made public.

   - Mary should ~rebase~ first, and then ~push~. NOT in opposite direction.

   - ~git rebase -i master~ and edit to get
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       pick 681bd1c Add CSS styles for headings and links
       squash eabac68 Add CSS styles for 3rd level headings
     #+END_SRC
     Then, combine commit with the message
     "Add CSS styles for headings and links"

   Mary shouldn't push the css-edits branch to the server, since it's NO longer
   under development, and other collaborators wouldn't know what it contains.

   However, if in a scenario that CSS is still in development, and some
   developers decide to work on it together, then keep this branch is
   reasonable.

   - Simulate the untrusted developer John, and he does NOT have the permission

   - =TODO= https, http =RE-READ=
     Note that John used a different path for pushing to his public repository
     than the one he gave us for fetching from it. The most important
     distinction is the transport protocol: the former used https:// while the
     latter used http://. Accessing a repository over HTTPS (or SSH) lets you
     fetch or push, but as we saw, requires a password. This prevents unknown
     developers from overwriting commits. On the other hand, fetching over HTTP
     requires no username or password, but pushing is not possible. This lets
     anyone fetch from a repository without compromising its security. In the
     integrator workflow, other developers access your repository via HTTP,
     while you publish changes via HTTPS. This is also the reason why John can’t
     push to his origin remote. Of course, if you’re working on a private
     project, anonymous HTTP access would be disabled for that repository.

   - Whereas remote repositories are a way to share entire branches,

     patches are a way to send individual commits to another developer.

   - Keep in mind:
     patches are usually only sent to a project maintainer.

     This is important! You MUSTN'T send your patches to multiple user, who may
     apply these patches in different order.
