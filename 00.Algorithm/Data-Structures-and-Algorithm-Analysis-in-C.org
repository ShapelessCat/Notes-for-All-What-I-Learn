   - The ability to do an analysis usually provides insight into designing efficient algorithms.
   - The analysis also generally pinpoints the bottlenecks, which are worth coding carefully.
*** 2.4.1.  A Simple Example
    #+BEGIN_SRC c
    int
    Sum(int N) {
        int PartialSum = 0;

        for(int i=1; i <= N; ++i) {
            PartialSum = PartialSum + i*i*i;
        }

        return PartialSum;
    }
    #+END_SRC
*** 2.4.2.  General Rules
    - RULE 1 -- ~for~ loops:
    - RULE 2 -- Nested ~for~ loops:
    - RULE 3 -- Consecutive Statements:
    - RULE 2 -- ~if/else~ loops:
