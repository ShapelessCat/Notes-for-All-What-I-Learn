*** TODO 1.1 Symbolic Computation
    - There are _FOUR_ important points to make about symbols:
      + 

      + 

      + NOT case sensitive in /Common Lisp/
        =footnote=: The variable ~*print-case*~ controls how symbols will be
                    printed.
                      By default, the value of this variable is ~:UPCASE~, but it
                    can be changed to ~:downcase~ or ~:capitalize~.
                    =TODO= How to change it???

      + The exact rules for what constitutes a symbol are a little complicated.
        =TODO=
        but the normal convention:
        * letters
        * dash (-)
        * numbers
        * characters like: ? 1 $/<=>
        * There are a few exceptions to these naming conventions, =TODO=
          which will be dealt with as they come up. =TODO=

*** DONE 1.2 Variables
    CLOSED: [2017-05-01 Mon 01:43]
    - give a value to a variable:
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (setf p '(John 0 Public)
      #+END_SRC

    - In /common lisp/,
      variable names and function names are in _DIFFERENT_ /name spaces/.

*** DONE 1.3 Special Forms
    CLOSED: [2017-05-01 Mon 01:43]
    - Besides the syntax of atoms and function calls.
      Lisp has a small number of syntactic expressions. They are known as /special forms/.

    - They serve the same purpose as statements in other programming languages,
      and indeed have some of the same syntactic markers, such as ~if~ and
      ~loop~.

    - There are _TWO_ main differences between Lisp's syntax and other languages:
      1. _Lisp's syntactic forms are always lists_ (even the /special forms/)
         in which _the first element is_ one of a small number of
         _privileged symbols_.
           For example:
         ~setf~ is one of these symbols, so ~(setf x 10)~ is a special form.

      2. /special forms/ are expressions that return a value.

    - The philosophy of Lisp is:
      provide _a small number of_ /special forms/ to do the things that could not
      otherwise be done, and then to expect the user to write everthing else as
      functions.

    - Terminology:
      ~setf~ is a /special form operator/
      ~(setf x 3)~ is a /special form expression/

    - OLD Terminology (_DEPRECATED_):
      In the book /Common LISPcraft/ Wilensky resolves the ambiguity by calling
      + ~setf~ a /special function/, and reserving the term
      + /special form/ for ~(setf χ 3 )~.

      This terminology implies that ~setf~ is just another function, but a
      special one in that _its first argument is NOT evaluated_.
        Such a view made sense in the days when Lisp was primarily an interpreted
      language.
        The modern view is that ~setf~ should not be considered some kind of
      abnormal function but rather _a marker of special syntax_ that will be
      handled specially by the compiler.

    - The /special form/ operators used _in THIS chapter_ are:
      | name               | definition                                   |
      |--------------------+----------------------------------------------|
      | ~def~              | define function                              |
      | ~defparameter~     | define special variable                      |
      | ~setf~             | set variable or field to new value           |
      | ~let~              | bind local variable(s)                       |
      | ~case~             | choose one of several alternatives           |
      | ~if~               | do one thing or another, depending on a test |
      | ~function~ or ~#'~ | refer to a function                          |
      | ~quote~ or ~'~     | introduce constant data                      |

*** DONE 1.4 Lists
    CLOSED: [2017-04-30 Sun 22:42]
    - ~first~, ~last~, ~second~, ~third~, ~fourth~, ~length~
      =COMMENT=: the return value of ~last~ is the last /cons cell/,
                 NOT the last elment of a list or /cons cell/
                 _THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM_ scheme/racket

    - empty list: ~()~ or ~nil~

    - ~cons~, ~append~

*** DONE 1.5 Defining New Functions
    CLOSED: [2017-04-30 Sun 22:54]
    - ~defun~ (/special form/)
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (defun function-name (parameter ...)
        "documentation string"
        function-body...)
      #+END_SRC

*** DONE 1.6 Using Functions
    CLOSED: [2017-04-30 Sun 23:29]
    - ~mapcar~
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (mapcar #'last-name names)
      (mapcar #'- '(1 2 3 4))  ; => (-1 -2 -3 -4)
      (mapcar #'+ '(1 2 3 4) '(10 20 30 40))  ; => (11 22 33 44)
      #+END_SRC

    - ~car~ and ~cdr~ are the instructions that were used in the first
      implementation of Lisp on IBM 704, and they are the abbreviations of
      _"contents of the address register"_ and
      _"contents of the decrement register"_, respectively.

    - ~defparameter~ (a /special form/)

    - _CONVENTION_: mark special variables by spelling their names with asterisks
      on either end.

    - _ONLY_ the value ~nil~ is considered _false_.

    - Better ~first-name~:
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (defparameter *titles*
        '(Mr Mrs Miss Ms Sir Madam Dr Admiral Major General)
        "A list of titles that can appear at the start of a name.")
      
      (defun first-name (name)
        "Select the first name from a name represented as a list."
        (if (member (first name) *title*)
            (first-name (rest name))
            (first name)))
      #+END_SRC

    - =TODO= =TODO= =TODO=
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8927741/whats-difference-between-defvar-defparameter-setf-and-setq
      Both ~defvar~ and ~defparameter~ will declare a variable as a _"dynamically
      scoped variable"_, and there is _no chance_ to define a lexical scope
      variable in common lisp (except using maroc in some way that I don't know).

        In addition, ~defparameter~ will _ALWAYS_ set the value of the variable
      to the value you pass in as the second argument.
        This is _DIFFERENT_ from ~defvar~, it will _ONLY_ set the value of the
      variable _if it previously hasn't been set_.

    - Two /special forms/: ~trace~, ~untrace~

*** DONE 1.7 Higher-Order Functions
    CLOSED: [2017-05-01 Mon 01:31]
    - ~apply~:
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (apply #'+ '(1 2 3 4))
      ; => 10
      #+END_SRC

    - ~funcall~: this is similar to ~apply~, but the arguments are listed
      separately.
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (funcall #'+ 2 3)  ;=> 5
      #+END_SRC

    - Lambda derives from the notation in Russell and Whitehead's
      /Principia Mathematica/, which used a caret over bound variables. =CAN'T TYPE=
        Church wanted a one-dimensional string, so he moved the caret in front.
      This is a little wired, so Church switched to the closest thing, and upper-
      case lambda, ~\Lambda{}x(x + x)~. This \Lambda was easily confused with other symbols, so
      eventually the lowercase lambda was substituted: ~\lambda{}x(x + x)~.

    - lambda expression:
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (lambda (parameters...) body...)
      #+END_SRC

    - A list is evaluated in one of two ways.
      1. If the first element of the list is a /special form/ operator,
         then the list is evaluated according to the syntax rule for that
         /special form/.

      2. Otherwise, the list represents a function call.
         The first element is evaluated in a unique way, as a function.

    - If we want to refer to a function in a position other than the first
      element of a function call, we have to use the ~#'~ notation.
        Otherwise, the expressions will be evaluated by the normal evaluation
      rule, and will not be treated as functions.
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      ; #1
      ; prompt>
      append  ; => Error: APPEND is not a bound variable

      ; #2
      ; prompt>
      (lambda (x) (+ x 2))  ; => Error: LAMBDA is not a function
       ;; this is not the case in sbcl
      #+END_SRC
      =IMPORTANT=
      For #2 this is not the case in sbcl.

    - For the current version of sbcl:
      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      ; #1
      ; prompt>
      (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x x))
              '(1 2 3 4 5))  ;=> (2 4 6 8 10)

      (mapcar (lambda (x) (+ x x))
              '(1 2 3 4 5))  ;=> (2 4 6 8 10)

      ; #2
      ; prompt>
      (mapppend #'(lambda (l) (list l (reverse l)))
                '((1 2 3) (a b c))  ;=> ((1 2 3) (3 2 1) (A B C) (C B A))
      
      (mapppend (lambda (l) (list l (reverse l)))
                '((1 2 3) (a b c))  ;=> ((1 2 3) (3 2 1) (A B C) (C B A))
      #+END_SRC

    - numbers, symbols, lists, functions, vectors, arrays, structures,
      characters, streams, hash tables, and others.

    - Lisp actually defined about _25_ different types of objects.

*** TODO 1.9 Summary: The Lisp Evaluation Rule
    - Summary:
      + Every expression is either a ~list~ or an ~atom~.

      + Every list to be evaluated is
        * a /special form expression/
        * a /function application/.
        =FROM JIAN= it seems ~lambda~ is special, =TOOD=
                    it will be prefixed with ~#'~ automatically.

      + /special form expressoin/

      + /function application/

      + Every /atom/ is either a _symbol_ or a _nonsymbol_

      + A /symbol/ evaluates to the most recent value that has been assigned to the
        variable named by that symbol. =TODO= =???= =closure???=
          Symbol name rules.
