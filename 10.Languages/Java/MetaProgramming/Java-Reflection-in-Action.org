  - Steps of modifying code:
    1. Examine the program for its structure or data.
    2. Make decisions using the results of the examination.
    3. Change the behavior, structure, or data of the program based upon the decisions.

  - As programmer, you must be familiar with steps, which are the things you do
    in your everyday work.
      Learning /reflection/ allows you your program do this adaptation for you.

  - Example:
    #+begin_src java
      public class HelloWorld {
          public void printName() {
              System.out.println(this.getClass().getName());
          }
      }
    #+end_src
    You can see the 3 steps in this example. The ~printName~ method
    1. _examines_ the object for its class (~this.getClass()~).
    2. In doing so, the _decision_ of what to print is made by delegating to the object's class.
    3. The method _acts on this decision_ BY printing the returned name.

  - Without /reflection/, to do the work in the above example, we need hardcode as
    ~System.out.println("HelloWord")~, and override the ~printName~ in every subclass
    of ~HelloWord~.

** DONE 1.1 Reflection's value proposition - 3
   CLOSED: [2019-05-15 Wed 13:16]
   - reflection :: the ability of a running program to examine itself and its software
                   environment, and to change what it does depending on what it finds.

   - metadata :: the information _represent something itself_.

   - metaobjects :: in an object-oriented world, the objects of the organized
                    /metadata/.

   - introspection :: the runtime self-examination of the /metaobjects/

   - The /introspection/ step is FOLLOWED BY _behavior change_.

   - In general, there are _THREE techniques_ that a reflection API can use to
     facilitate behavior change:
     + DIRECT /metaobject/ *modification*

     + *operations* for using /metadata/ (such as /dynamic method invocation/)

     + /intercession/, in which code is permitted to intercede in various phases
       of program execution.

   - Summary:
     + Java *supplies*
       * _a RICH set_ of operations for using /metadata/
       * _JUST a FEW_ important /intercession/ capabilities

     + Java *avoids*
       many complications by *NOT allowing* /direct metaobject modification/.

   - /Reflection/ make your software _flexible_:
     + Applications programmed with /reflection/ adapt _more easily to CHANGING_
       requirements.

     + Reflective components are more likely to be _reused_ flawlessly in other
       applications.

   - You must master the subject in order to make your software flexible.
     1. It's not enough to just learn the concepts and the use of the API.
     2. You must also be able to distinguish between situations
        + when reflection is absolutely required from those
        + when it may be used advantageously from those
        + when it should be shunned.

   - The examples in this book will help you acquire this skill (=from Jian=
     metioned in the last entry).

   - In addition, by the time you reach the end, you will understand the three
     issues that have thus far impeded the broad use of /reflection/:
     =IMPORTANT=
     + /security/
     + /code complexity/
     + /runtime performance/

   - You will learn that the concern over security was misguided. Java is so well
     crafted and its reflection API so carefully constrained that security is
     controlled simply.

     + By learning when to use reflection and when not to,
       you will avoid unnecessarily complex code that can often be the result of
       amateurish use of reflection.

     + In addition, you will learn to evaluate the performance of your designs,
       thereby ensuring the resulting code satisfies its performance requirements.

   - This introduction describes /reflection/, but scarcely *reveals its value*.

   - /Reflection/ — introspection followed by behavior change - is the path to
     flexible software.

** DONE 1.2 Enter George the programmer - 4 - =RE-READ=
   CLOSED: [2020-09-11 Fri 04:29]
   - Q :: How to invoke ~setColor~ no matter what the EXACT /class/ is?
     + Then scenario:
       George's team wants to integrate some components, all of which have ~setColor~
       /methods/ and accept ~java.awt.Color~ parameter (same signature).
         However, since those componets comes from different sources, they don't
       have a common /base class/ who has the ~setColor~ /method/ we expect. Their
       only /base class/ is ~Object~, which can't tells the compiler all the
       componets have the ~setColor~ /method/, even though the team knows all the
       componets they will integrate will always have ~setColor~.

*** DONE 1.2.1 Choosing reflection - 5
    CLOSED: [2020-09-11 Fri 04:30]
    - Given a component, the team's code must accomplish _TWO_ steps:
      1. Discover a ~setColor~ /method/ supported by the component.
      2. Call that ~setColor~ /method/ with the desired color.

    - There are many alternatives for accomplishing these steps manually.
      Let's examine the results of each of these.
      + _George's team controlled all of the source code_:
        the components could be refactored to implement a common interface that
        declares ~setColor~.
          Then, each component could be referenced by that /interface type/ and
        ~setColor~ could be invoked without knowing the /concrete type/.
        * =from Jian= It is rarely happen that all source code are under control.

      + _The team does NOT control the standard Java components or third-party
        components_:
        Even if they changed the open source components, the open source project
        might not accept the change, leaving the team with additional maintenance.

        * The team could implement an _ADAPTER_ for each component.
          Each such adapter could implement a /COMMON interface/ and *delegate* the
          ~setColor~ call to the concrete component.
          - Usually people will see the *LIMITATIONS* when a large number of component
            classes need to be supported -- the problem that George's team need
            to handle.
            1. because of the _large number_ of _component CLASSES_ that the team is
               using, the solution would cause an EXPLOSION in the number of classes
               to _maintain_.

            2. because of the _large number_ of _component INSTANCES_, this solution
               would cause an EXPLOSION of the number of objects in the system _at
               runtime_.

          - Conclusion:
            These trade-offs make implementing an adapter an *undesirable* option.
            + =from Jian=
               *undesirable* means those limitations actually eliminate this solution
               in the large number of components situations.

      + Using ~instanceof~ and *casting* to discover /concrete types/ _at runtime_
        is another alternative,
        * BUT it leaves several maintenance problems for George's team.
          1. The code would become bloated with conditionals and casts, making it
             difficult to read and understand.

          2. The code would become *coupled* with each /concrete type/.
             This *coupling* would make it more difficult for the team to add,
             remove, or change components.

        * These problems make ~instanceof~ and *casting* an _unfavorable_ alternative.
          - =from Jian=
            *unfavorable* here means even with those limitations this solution is
            applicable. However, it's not good, and it will lead to a workable, but
            _hard to maintain_ situation. *Hard to maintain* can also effectively
            eliminate this solution -- the time spent on it can be to much if compare
            with the gained benefits.

      + Conclusion:
        =from Jian=
        The solutions above all have obvious limitations. HOWEVER, the can
        provide some insights on solving this problem.

        1. EACH of these alternatives involves program changes that *adjust or
           discover the type of a component*.

        2. George understands that it is ONLY necessary to find a ~setColor~ /method/
           and call it.

        3. Having studied a little /reflection/, he understands how to query an object's
           class for a method at runtime.

        4. Once it is found, he knows that a method can also be invoked using /reflection/.

        5. /Reflection/ is uniquely suited to solving this problem because it does
           not over-constrain the solution with type information.

** TODO 1.3 Examining running programs - 8
   - /Reflection/ is a program's ability to _examine_ and _change_ its BEHAVIOR
     and STRUCTURE _at runtime_.

   - Let's take a closer look at what _reflective abilities_ mean for the *structure*
     of Java.

   - exaggerated =EN=

   - metaobjects :: program's self-representation

   - /Meta/ is a prefix that usually _about_ or _beyond_.
     In this case, /metaobjects/ are objects that hold info ABOUT the program.

   - The ~Class~ and ~Method~ we mentioned are /classes/ whose /instances/ _represent
     the program_.
       We refer to these as /classes of metaobjects/ or /metaobject classes/.
     /Metaobject classes/ are most of what make up Java's reflection API.

   - /base-level objects/ =TODO=

   - base program :: nonreflective parts of a program

   - UML =TODO=

   - Figure 1.1 =TODO=

   - _Reflective abilities_ that make changes include:
     + *dynamic invocation* to call a /method/ that find through introspection
     + reflective *construction*
     + *dynamic loading*
     + *intercepting* method calls

     This book shows how to use these mechanisms and others to solve common but
     difficult software problems.

** DONE 1.4 Finding a method at runtime - 10
   CLOSED: [2019-05-20 Mon 18:53]
   - No introspection about a value/type can be used _until_ it knows the /class/
     of the parameter.

     Query for the parameter's class is always the first step:
     ~Class cls = obj.getClass();~

   - The ~getClass~ /method/ is used to access an object's /class/ _at runtime_.

   - The ~getClass~ /method/ is often used to *begin* /reflective programming/
     because MANY (=from Jian= NOT ALL???) /reflective/ tasks REQUIRE _objects
     representing classes_.

   - The ~getClass~ /method/ is introduced by ~java.lang.Object~, so _any_ /object/
     in Java can be queried for its ~class~.

   - The ~getClass~ /method/ is ~final~.

   - The ~getClass~ /method/ returns an instance of ~java.lang.Class~.
     Instances of ~Class~ are the /metaobjects/ that Java uses _to *represent*
     the classes that make up a program_.

   - class object (throughout this book) :: an /instance/ of ~java.lang.Class~.

   - /Class objects/ are the most important kind of /metaobject/
     because all Java programs consist solely of /classes/.

   - /Class objects/ provide programming _metadata_ about a /class/'s /fields/,
     /methods/, /constructors/, and /nested classes/.

   - /Class objects/ also provide information about the /inheritance hierarchy/
     and provide _ACCESS to reflective facilities_.

   - For this chapter,
     _we will *CONCENTRATE ON* the use of ~Class~ in listing 1.1 and related
     fundamentals._
     + Table 1.1 The /methods/ defined by ~Class~ for /method/ query
       * Returns a ~Method~ /object/ that represents a /public method/ (either
         _declared or inherited_)
         #+begin_src java
           Method getMethod(String name, Class[] parameterTypes)
         #+end_src
         + ~name~: method name
         + ~parameterTypes~: signature

       * Returns an array of ~Method~ /objects/ that represent all of the
         /public methods/ (either _declared or inherited_)
         #+begin_src java
           Method[] getMethods()
         #+end_src

       * Returns a ~Method~ /object/ that represents a *declared method*
         #+begin_src java
           Method getDeclaredMethod(String name, Class[] parameterTypes )
         #+end_src
         + ~name~: method name
         + ~parameterTypes~: signature

       * Returns an array of ~Method~ /objects/ that represent ALL of the /methods/
         *declared*
         #+begin_src java
           Method[] getDeclaredMethods()
         #+end_src

   - In querying for a *parameterless* /method/, it is LEGAL to supply ~null~,
     which is treated *the same as* a _zero-length array_.

   - The set of /declared methods/ does *NOT include* /methods/ that the /class/
     /inherits/.
       However, these two queries do return /methods/ of *all visibilities*:
     /public/, /protected/, /package/, and /private/.

   - ~getMethod~ and ~getMethods~ return /method objects/ for a /class/'s
     /public methods/.
       The set of /methods/ covered by these two includes BOTH /methods/
     *declared* by the /class/ and those it *inherits from* /superclasses/.
     However, these queries return *only* a /class/'s /public methods/.

   - When one /method/ can't be found, the query fails with a ~NoSuchMethodException~.
     This often happens when a /method/ is there, but you use a wrong way to
     query, like
     + for ~getDeclaredMethod~, try to find the /method/ not declared by it.
     + for ~getMethod~, try to find out non-public methods.

   - Once the ~setObjectColor~ /method/ has discovered the /class/ of its parameter,
     it queries that /class/ for the /method/ it wants to call:
     #+begin_src java
       Method method = cls.getMethod("setColor", new Class[] {Color.class});
     #+end_src
     + The first parameter is the name of the being invoked /method/.

     + The second parameter is an _array_ of /class objects/ that identify the
       types of the method's parameters.
         In this case, we want a /method/ that accepts _ONE parameter_ of /type/
       ~Color~, so we pass ~getMethod~ an _array_ of one element containing the
       /class object/ for ~Color~.

   - Notice that the assignment does *NOT* use ~getClass~ to provide the /class
     object/ for ~Color~.
     + Get the /class/ from an /object reference/: ~instance.getClass()~;
     + Get the /class/ from the /class/ we know: ~ClassName.class~ (static).

   - Class literals :: Any _class_ followed by ~.class~ evaluates to a /class
                       object/.

   - Class has other methods for introspecting about methods. The signatures and
     return types for these methods are shown in table 1.1. As in the previous
     example, the queries use an array of Class to indicate the types of the
     parameters. In querying for a parameterless method, it is legal to supply
     null, which is treated the same as a zero-length array.

   - =TODO=
     We discuss /method objects/ _in detail_ later in THIS chapter, but first
     let's take a closer look at how /class objects/ are used with the /methods/
     _from_ table 1.1.

     #+begin_src java
       Method method = cls.getMethod("setColor", new class[] {Color.class});
     #+end_src

   - We need a /method/ that _introspects_ over /methods/ of *all visibilities,
     declared or inherited*.
     + Listing 1.3 Code for ~Mopex.getSupportedMethod~
       #+begin_src java

             catch (NoSuchMethodException ex) {
                 return getSupportedMethod(cls.getSuperclass(), name, paramTypes);
             }

             catch (NoSuchMethodException ex) {
                 throw new IllegalArgumentException(cls.getName() + " does not support" + "method setColor(:Color)");
             }

   - The above update allows ~setObjectColor~ to retrieve /metaobjects/ for
     /private/, /package/, and /protected/ /methods/ that are not retrieved by
     ~getMethod~.
       However, _this update does NOT GUARANTEE *permission to invoke* the /method/._
     If ~setObjectColor~ does not have access to Martha's _inherited method_, an
     ~IllegalAccessException~ is thrown instead of a ~NoSuchMethodException~.

     In chapter 2, we discuss bypassing visibility checks using reflection.

        _true_ iff the specified ~Object~ is /assignment-compatible/ with the
        object represented by the target ~Class~ object

        * ~isInstance~ /method/ is _Java reflection's dynamic version of ~instanceof~._
          - ~classClassObj.isInstance~ returns _true_
            if its argument is an /instance/ of _that class or ANY subclass of that
            class._

          - ~interfaceClassObj.isInstance~ returns _true_
            if its argument's class implements _that interface or ANY subinterface
            of that interface._

    - Note the method names getInterfaces and getSuperclass are slightly inconsistent
      with terminology defined by the Java Language Specification. A direct superclass
      is the one named in the extends clause of a class declaration. A class X is a
      superclass of a class Y if there is a sequence of one or more direct superclass links
      from Y to X. There is a corresponding pair of definitions for direct superinterface
      and superinterface. Consequently, getSuperclass returns the direct superclass
      and getInterfaces returns the direct superinterfaces.
