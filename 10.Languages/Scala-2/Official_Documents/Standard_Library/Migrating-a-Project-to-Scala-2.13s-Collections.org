* Tools for migrating and cross-building
* ~scala.Seq~, varargs and ~scala.IndexedSeq~ migration
** Migrating varargs
** Option 1: migrate back to ~scala.collection.Seq~
** Option 2: use ~scala.collection.Seq~ for parameters and ~scala.collection.immutable.Seq~ for result types
** Option 3: use immutable sequences
** Shadowing ~scala.Seq~ and ~scala.IndexedSeq~
* What are the breaking changes?
* Breaking changes with old syntax still supported
* Deprecated things in 2.12 that have been removed in 2.13
* Are there new collection types?
* Are there new operations on collections?
* Are there new implementations of existing collection types (changes in performance characteristics)?
* How do I cross-build my project against Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13?
