* Overview
  - *Enumeratum* is a type-safe and powerful enumeration implementation for Scala
    that offers
    * _exhaustive pattern match warnings_,
    * _integrations with popular Scala libraries_, and
    * _idiomatic usage that won't break your IDE_.

  - It aims to
    * be similar enough to _Scala's built in Enumeration_ to be easy-to-use and understand
    * WHILE offering more
      + flexibility,
      + type-safety (see this blog post describing erasure on Scala's Enumeration), and
      + richer enum values WITHOUT having to maintain your own collection of values.

  - *Enumeratum* has the following niceties:
    * Zero dependencies

    * Performant: Faster than ~Enumeration~ in the standard library (see _benchmarks_)

    * Allows your Enum members to be full-fledged normal objects with methods,
      values, inheritance, etc.

    * ~ValueEnum~'s that map to various primitive values and have compile-time
      uniqueness constraints.

    * Idiomatic: you're very clearly still writing Scala, and no funny colours in
      your IDE means less cognitive overhead for your team

    * Simplicity; most of the complexity in this lib is in its macro, and the
      macro is fairly simple conceptually

    * No usage of reflection at runtime. This may also help with performance but
      it means Enumeratum is compatible with ScalaJS and other environments
      where reflection is a best effort (such as Android)

    * No usage of ~synchronized~, which may help with performance and deadlocks
      prevention

    * All magic happens at compile-time so you know right away when things go
      awry

    * Comprehensive automated testing to make sure everything is in tip-top shape

  - *Enumeratum* is published for
    + Scala 2.11.x, 2.12.x, 2.13.x
    + ScalaJS
