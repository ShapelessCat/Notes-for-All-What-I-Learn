   - Design Patterns (The formal definition) ::
        A design pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem in
        software design. It is not a finished piece of code but a template that
        helps to solve a particular problem or family of problems.

   - Feature-rich languages might not even need a /design pattern/, while others
     still do.

   - The lack or existence of a certain functionality within aprogramming language
     also makes it able to implement additional /design patterns/ that others
     cannot. The opposite is also valid -- it might not be able to implement
     things that others can.

*** DONE Scala and design patterns
    CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 11:54]
    - The hybrid nature of the Scala makes some of the /traditional object-oriented
      design patterns/ _obsolete_, or possible, using _other cleaner techniques_.

** DONE Design pattern categories - =RE-READ= =IMPORTANT=
   CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 12:45]
   - Even if there are many different /design patterns/, they can all be grouped
     in the following:
     + Creational

     + Structural

     + Behavioral

     + Functional

     + Scala-specific design patterns
       * Some of these /design patterns/ can be assigned to the previous groups.
         - They can either be _additions_ or _replacements_ of the already
           existing ones.

         - They are typical to Scala and take advantage of some advanced language
           features or simply features not available in other languages.)

   - The _first three groups_ contain the famous /Gang of Four design patterns/.

     The rest, even if they can be assigned to one of the first three groups, will
     be specific to Scala and functional programming languages.

     =TODO=
     In the next few subsections, we will explain the main characteristics of
     the listed groups and briefly present the actual design patterns that fall
     under them.

*** TODO Creational design patterns
    - The /creational design patterns/ deal with /object creation mechanisms/.

      + *PURPOSE*: create objects in a way that is suitable to the current situation,
        which could lead to unnecessary complexity and the need for extra
        knowledge if they were not there.

      + The main ideas behind the /creational design patterns/ are as follows:
        * *Knowledge encapsulation* about the concrete classes

        * *Hiding details* about the actual creation and how objects are combined

**** TODO The abstract factory design pattern
**** TODO The factory method design pattern
**** TODO The lazy initialization design pattern
**** TODO The singleton design pattern
**** TODO The object pool design pattern
**** TODO The builder design pattern
**** TODO The prototype design pattern

*** TODO Structural design patterns
    - /Structural design patterns/ exist in order to help establish the
      relationships between different entities in order to _form larger
      structures_.

        They define how each component should be structured so that it has very
      flexible interconnecting modules that can work together in a larger
      system.

    - The main features of /structural design patterns/ include the following:
      + The use of composition to combine the implementations of multiple objects

      + Help build a large system made of various components by maintaining a high
        level of flexibility

**** TODO The adapter design pattern
**** TODO The decorator design pattern
**** TODO The bridge design pattern
**** TODO The composite design pattern
**** TODO The facade design pattern
**** TODO The flyweight design pattern
**** TODO The proxy design pattern

*** TODO Behavioral design patterns
    - /Behavioral design patterns/ increase *communication flexibility* between
      objects based on the specific ways they interact with each other.

      Here,
      + /creational patterns/ mostly describe a moment in time during creation,
      + /structural patterns/ describe a more or less static structure,
      + /behavioral patterns/ describe a process or flow.

      They simplify this flow and make it more understandable.

    - The main features of /behavioral design patterns/ are as follows:
      + What is being described is a process or flow

      + The flows are simplified and made understandable

      + They accomplish tasks that would be difficult or impossible to achieve
        with objects

**** The value object design pattern
**** The null object design pattern
**** The strategy design pattern
**** The command design pattern
**** The chain of responsibility design pattern
**** The interpreter design pattern
**** The iterator design pattern
**** The mediator design pattern
**** The memento design pattern
**** The observer design pattern
**** The state design pattern
**** The template method design pattern
**** The visitor design pattern

*** DONE Functional design patterns
    CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 12:37]
**** DONE Monoids
     CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 12:29]
     - Concept

     - What is important about /monoids/ is that
       + they give us the possibility to work with many different types of values
         in a common way.

       + They allow us to convert pairwise operations to *work with sequences*;
       + the /associativity/ gives us the possibility for *parallelization*
       + the /identity element/ allows us to know what to do with empty lists.

       /Monoids/ are *GREAT to EASILY* _describe and implement *aggregations*._

**** DONE Monads
     CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 12:37]
     - /Monads/ are algebraic structures that REPRESENT _computations as sequences
       of steps_.

     - /Monads/ are useful for
       + building pipelines

       + adding operations with side effects cleanly to a language where everything
         is immutable

       + implementing compositions.
         =From Jian= Especially for data structures with embedded sub-structures

**** DONE Functors
     CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 12:34]
     - This concept comes from /category theory/.

     - For now, you could remember that /functors/ are things that can allow us
       to *lift* a function of the /type/ ~A => B~ to a function of the /type/
       ~F[A] => F[B]~.

*** DONE Scala-specific design patterns

**** Stackable traits
**** The type class design pattern

**** Partial functions
**** Implicit injection
**** Duck typing
**** Memoization

** DONE Choosing a design pattern - =Re-REAd= =IMPORTANT=
   CLOSED: [2018-08-14 Tue 01:19]
   - About how to *use* /a design pattern/ or *combine* /design patterns/, you
     should consider (this is BY NO MEANS an exhaustive list of questions):
     + Is this piece of code
       going to be _fairly static_ OR will it _change in the future_?

     + Do we have to _dynamically decide_ what /algorithms/ to use?

     + Is our code going to be _used by others_?

     + Do we have an agreed /interface/?

     + _What libraries_ are we planning to use, if any?

     + Are there any _special performance requirements or limitations_?

   - In the rest of the chapters, we will try to give specific recommendations
     about _when a /design pattern/ should and should NOT be used._ =TODO=

     =IMPORTANT=
     They should help you ask the right questions and take the right decision
     before going on and writing code.

** DONE Summary
   CLOSED: [2018-08-14 Tue 01:26]
   - In MANY CASES, we could _use Scala's features_
     in order to
     _make a pattern OBSOLETE, SIMPLER, or DIFFERENT to implement compared to
     the classical case like in old Java (Before Java 8)_.

* TODO 2. Traits and Mixin Compositions
  - Clarify some Scala concepts which
    + can be used to implement some /design patterns/,
      OR
    + because of their existence, can replace some /design patterns/

  - We will go through the following main topics in this chapter:
    + /Traits/
    + /Mixin compositions/
    + /Multiple inheritance/
    + /Linearization/
    + Testing /traits/
    + /Traits/ vs. /classes/

** DONE Traits
   CLOSED: [2019-06-06 Thu 10:12]
   - In the following few sections,
     =TODO=
     we will see the /traits/
     + from different points of view
       and
     + try to give you some ideas about how they can be used.

*** DONE Traits as interfaces
    CLOSED: [2019-06-06 Thu 10:00]
    - mixin :: a /trait/ that contains some concrete code

    - =from Jian=
      It seems we can category /traits/ as (*in my words*):
      + interface traits

      + mixin traits (similar to /abstract class/ in other languages)

    - Example (these /traits/ are used in the next section -- Mixin compositions):
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        trait Alarm {  // from Jian: interface trait
          def trigger(): String
        }

        trait Notifier {  // from Jian: mixin trait
          val notificationMessage: String

          def printNotification(): Unit = {
            System.out.println(notificationMessage)
          }

          def clear()
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - Moreover, the /traits/ can _require_ a /class/ that mix it in to _have a specific
      variable inside it_. This is somewhat *similar to /abstract classes/ in other
      languages*.

**** DONE Mixing in traits with variables
     CLOSED: [2018-10-04 Thu 22:43]
     When a /trait/ requires the /class/ that mix it in to _hava a specific
     variable_, pass the variable (=from Jian= of course, must be a /property/,
     ~var~ or ~val~, corresponding to the one in the given /trait/) to the
     /constructor/ of this /class/ would satisfy this requirement.
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       class NotifierImpl(val notificationMessage: String) extends Notifier {
         override def clear(): Unit = System.out.println("cleared")
       }
     #+END_SRC

     - Here you apply ~val~ on ~notificationMessage~, then it is a part of the
       /class/ as a /field/, and a /getter/ will be generated for it.
       (*required*: 1. ~val~; 2. same name ~notificationMessage~)

     - If there is NO ~val~, we need implement ~notificationMessage~ in the body
       with ~override val notificationMessage~ (for implementing /trait field/,
       ~override~ is *optional* -- =from Jian= I think keep using ~override~ is
       a good practice -- a hint to its origin. However, I don't think ~override~
       meaning is fit for this, I prefer a NOT ACTUALLY EXIST in Scala keyword
       like ~impl~).

     - If we explicitly use ~val~ (or ~var~), the compiler will create a /field/
       with a /getter/ with the *same scope* as the parameter.
       =IMPORTANT= =I DON'T KNOW BEFORE= =!!!=
         If we just have the parameter, a /field/ and _internal_ /getter/ will be
       created _only if_ the parameter is used _outside_ the /constructor scope/,
       for example, in a /method/. For completeness, case classes automatically
       have the ~val~ keyword prepended to parameters.

*** DONE Traits as classes
    CLOSED: [2019-06-06 Thu 10:06]
    - /Traits/ can also be seen _from the perspective of_ /classes/.
      In this case, they
      + have to *implement ALL their methods*
      + have ONLY ONE /constructor/ that _does *NOT* accept *ANY* parameters_.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        trait Beeper {
          def beep(times: Int): Unit =
            (1 to times).
              map(i => s"Beep number: $i").
              foreach(println)
        }

        object BeeperRunner {
          val TIMES = 10

          def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
            // Because you can't instantiate a `trait`,
            // you CANNOT write `new Beeper` without the following `{}`
            val beeper = new Beeper {}
            beeper beep TIMES
          }
        }
      #+END_SRC

*** DONE Extending classes
    CLOSED: [2019-06-06 Thu 10:09]
    /Traits/ *can* extend /classes/.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        abstract class Connector {
          def connect()
          def close()
        }

        trait ConnectorWithHelper extends Connector {
          def findDriver(): Unit = {
            println("Find driver called.")
          }
        }

        class PgSqlConnector extends ConnectorWithHelper {
          override def connect(): Unit = {
            println("Connected...")
          }
          override def close(): Unit = {
            println("Closed...")
          }
        }
      #+END_SRC

      However, Scala will put a *limit* to some cases:
      It is forbided that extends multiple /traits/ that some of the /traits/
      extend *unrelated* (NOT in the SAME /inheritance chain/) /classes/.

*** DONE Extending traits
    CLOSED: [2019-06-06 Thu 10:12]
    /Traits/ can *extend* /traits/.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        trait Ping {
          def ping(): Unit = {
            System.out.println("ping")
          }
        }

        trait Pong {
          def pong(): Unit = {
            System.out.println("pong")
          }
        }

        trait PingPong extends Ping with Pong {
          def pingPong(): Unit = {
            ping()
            pong()
          }
        }

        object Runner extends PingPong {
          def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
            pingPong()
          }
        }
      #+END_SRC
      + This is just a example. Of course, your ~Runner~ can extends the /super
        traits/ of ~PingPong~, ~Ping~ and ~Pong~, DIRECTLY, rather than ~PingPong~
        itself.

*** DONE Composing
    CLOSED: [2018-10-06 Sat 01:27]
    Composing at _creation time_ gives us an opportunity to CREATE /anonymous
    classes/ *without* the need to explicitly define them with a name.

**** DONE Composing simple traits
     CLOSED: [2019-06-06 Thu 11:50]
     Compose simple /traits/, which do NOT extend other /traits/ or /classes/:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       class Watch(val brand: String, initialTime: Long) {
         def getTime(): Long = System.currentTimeMillis() - initialTime
       }

       object WatchUser {
         def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
           val expensiveWatch = new Watch("expensive brand", 1000L) with Alarm with Notifier {
             override def trigger: String = "The alarm was triggered."

             override def clear(): Unit = {
               System.out.println("Alarm cleared.")
             }

             override val notificationMessage: String = "Alarm is running!"
           }

           val cheapWatch = new Watch("cheap brand", 1000L) with Alarm {
             override def trigger: String = "The alarm was triggered."
           }

           // show some watch usage.
           System.out.println(expensiveWatch.trigger)
           expensiveWatch.printNotification()
           System.out.println(s"The time is ${expensiveWatch.getTime()}.")
           expensiveWatch.clear()
           System.out.println(cheapWatch.trigger)
           System.out.println(s"${cheapWatch.brand} watches cannot manually stop the alarm...")
         }
       }
     #+END_SRC
     =from Jian= The original code does neither use ~brand~, nor create a /field/
     for it. This is not reasonable -- I modified the code and convert ~brand~ to
     a ~val~ field.

**** DONE Composing complex traits
     CLOSED: [2018-10-06 Sat 01:02]
     - If a trait and no other trait up the inheritance chain extends a specific
       class explicitly, then things will be pretty simple and nothing change
       much.

     We defined ~ConnectorWithHelper~ /trait/ before, and it extends the
     /abstract class/ ~Connector~. Now let's use ~ConnectorWithHelper~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       object ReallyExpensiveWatchUser {
         def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
           val reallyExpensiveWatch =
             new Watch("really expensive brand", 1000L)
                 with ConnectorWithHelper {
               override def connect(): Unit = {
                 System.out.println("Connected with another connector.")
               }

               override def close(): Unit = {
                 System.out.println("Closed with another connector.")
               }
             }

           System.out.println("Using the really expensive watch.")
           reallyExpensiveWatch.findDriver()
           reallyExpensiveWatch.connect()
           reallyExpensiveWatch.close()
         }
       }
     #+END_SRC

     You compile the code above and will see a /compilation error/ like:
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
       Error:(36, 80) illegal inheritance; superclass Watch
        is not a subclass of the superclass Connector
        of the mixin trait ConnectorWithHelper
           val reallyExpensiveWatch = new Watch("really expensive brand", 1000L)
       with ConnectorWithHelper {
       ^
     #+END_SRC

     ~Watch~ is a /class/ and it is NOT the /subclass/ of ~Connector~, thus it
     *CANNOT* extends a /trait/ that extends ~Connector~ -- for here,
     ~ConnectorWithHelper~ is the one.

     This is a case that how Scala *limit* multiple inheritance in order to prevent
     dangerous errors from happening. (=from Jian= "limit" not "forbid" --
     /trait/ based /mutiple inheritance/ is still a /mutiple inheritance/).

**** DONE Composing with self-types
     CLOSED: [2018-10-06 Sat 01:27]
     We can *enforce* a /trait/ to be /mixed into/ a /class/ that also has another
     /trait/ or /multiple traits/ mixed into it.

     - Example:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         trait AlarmNotifier {
           this: Notifier =>

           def trigger(): String
         }
       #+END_SRC
       + Of course, ~this~ here must be ~AlarmNotifier~ itself, but it is also a
         ~Notifier~.

       + In the preceding code, we've shown a /self-type/.
         * The highlighted piece of code brings all the /methods/ of ~Notifier~
           to the scope of our new ~trait~
           and
         * it also requires that ANY /class/ that /mixes in/ ~AlarmNotifier~ should
           *also* /mix in/ ~Notifier~. Otherwise, a compilation error will occur.

       + Instead of this, we can use ~self~ and then refer to the ~Notifier~ /methods/
         inside ~AlarmNotifier~ by typing, for example, ~self.printNotification()~.

         =Urgent= =TODO= =IMPORTANT= =???= =Experiment=
         =from Jian= Does this mean if we write ~self: Notifier =>~, we can, in
         the body of this /trait/, use ~self~ to refer ~Notifier~ and use ~this~
         to refer ~AlarmNotifier~???

     - Code use the ~AlarmNotifier~ in the right way:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         object SelfTypeWatchUser {
           def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
             //// uncomment to see the self-type error.
             // val watch = new Watch("alarm with notification", 1000L) with AlarmNotifier
             val watch = new Watch("alarm with notification", 1000L) with
                 AlarmNotifier with Notifier {
               override def trigger(): String = "Alarm triggered."
               override def clear(): Unit = System.out.println("Alarm cleared.")
               override val notificationMessage: String = "The notification."
             }
             System.out.println(watch.trigger())
             watch.printNotification()
             System.out.println(s"The time is ${watch.getTime()}.")
             watch.clear()
           }
         }
       #+END_SRC

     - Multiple /traits/ /self-types/ are also allowed, just use ~with~.

     - /Self-types/ are a key part of the /cake design pattern/, which is used for
       /dependency injection/.
       =TODO= More interesting cases later in this book!

*** DONE The diamond problem
    CLOSED: [2018-10-07 Sun 15:57]
    In Scala, the ambiguity of /the diamond problem/ is resolved -- use
    /linearization/. Even though, it is still prone to errors (even the *order*
    of /traits/ matters). For example,
    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      trait A {
        def hello(): String = "Hello from A"
      }

      trait B extends A {
        override def hello(): String = "Hello from B"
      }

      trait C extends A {
        override def hello(): String = "Hello from C"
      }

      trait D extends B with C {
        override def hello(): String = "Hello from C"
      }

      object Diamond extends D {
        def main(args: Array[Strng]): Unit {
          System.our.println(hello())
        }
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - this print ="Hello from C"=
    - if we change the order by which ~D~ was implemented to ~trait D extends C with B~

*** DONE The limitations
    CLOSED: [2018-10-07 Sun 15:26]
    Scala *multiple inheritance limitations*:
    /Multiple inheritance/ in Scala is _achieved using_ /traits/
    and
    it follows the rules of /linearization/.

    - In the inheritance hierarchy, if there is a /trait/ that EXPLICITLY =???=
      extends a /class/, the /class/ that /mixes in/ this /trait/ *must also be
      a /subclass/ of the /trait/ parent.* This means that when /mixing in/
      /traits/ that extend /classes/, they must all have the same parent.

    - It is *not possible* to mix /traits/ in, which define or declare /methods/ with
      _the SAME /signatures/, but DIFFERENT /return types/._

** TODO Linearization
   - As we already saw, /traits/ offer a form of /multiple inheritance/.
     In such cases, the hierarchy is NOT NECESSARILY /linear/, but forms an
     /acyclic graph/ that needs to be flattened upon compilation.

     What /linearization/ does is this -- it specifies a single linear order for
     all of the ancestors of a /class/, including both the regular /superclass
     chain/ and the /parent chains of all of the traits/.

   - We will not have to deal with /linearization/ in _traits that contain no code_
     (=from Jian= in my word: /interface trait/).
     However, if we use /mixins/, we will have to consider it. The following will
     be affected by /linearization/:
     + Method definitions
     + Variables (both /mutable/ and /immutable/)

   - We already saw a simple example of linearization previously. Things, however,
     can get much more complicated and unexpected if the rules of /linearization/
     are not clear.
     =TODO= =TODO= =TODO=

*** DONE Rules of inheritance hierarchies
    CLOSED: [2018-10-07 Sun 17:20]
    Before looking into /linearization rules/, we need to be clear on some
    _inheritance rules in Scala_:

    - In Java, even if a class does not explicitly extend another one, its
      /superclass/ will be ~java.lang.Object~.

      The same stands for Scala, and the equivalent base is ~AnyRef~ .

      =From Comment= There was a ~ScalaObject~ in old Scala, which was
      implicitly added to ALL /traits/ and /classes/.

    - There is a SIMILARITY between =TODO= =???=
      + DIRECTLY *extending* a /trait/
        AND
      + *extending* the /trait superclass/
        and
        *mixing* the /trait/ in using the ~with~ keyword.

*** DONE Linearization rules - =TODO= =NOTE=
    CLOSED: [2018-10-07 Sun 17:20]
    - The linearization of ANY /class/ *must* include the unmodified linearization of any class (but not trait) that it extends.

*** DONE How linearization works - =TODO= =NOTE=
    CLOSED: [2018-10-07 Sun 17:20]
*** TODO Initialization
    Now that we know what happens during linearization,
    we will understand how instances are being created.

    compared to the /linearization order/.*

        evaluation/, /centralized exception handling/, and others,

* TODO 4. Abstract and Self Types
  - Designing and writing high-quality code in software engineering is important
    in order to have applications that are easy to extend and maintain.

    This activity requires the
    + domain to be well-known, correctly understood by a developer
    + the requirements for the application to be well-defined.

    If any of these are absent, then writing good programs becomes quite
    challenging.

  - We will look into the following topics in this chapter:
    + Abstract types
    + Polymorphism
    + Self types

  - This chapter can by itself help you writing good code.

  - This chapter is useful when we start looking into some of the concrete
    design patterns.

** TODO Abstract types
   We can _parameterize classes by using values_ -- instantiate a class with
   different values to get different instances -- just the construction
   parameters.

   For example, pass different names (string values) to ~case class Person(name:
   String)~.

*** DONE Generics
    CLOSED: [2018-09-21 Fri 17:04]
    - /Generics/ are another way of _parameterizing classes_.

    - The most signatures example of using /generics/ to _parameterizing
      classes_ is the collection types.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        trait Adder {
          def sum[T](a: T, b: T)(implicit numeric: Numeric[T]): T =
            numeric.plus(a, b)
        }
      #+END_SRC

      =TODO=
      =???=

*** TODO Abstract types
    - Another way to _parameterize classes is by using /abstract types/._

* 6. Creational Design Patterns
  - _Based on the aspects of a program on which a piece of code is written to
    solve a problem_, we can split /design patterns/ into the following main
    groups:
    + *Creational*

    + *Structural*

    + *Behavioral*

  - This chapter will focus on the /creational design patterns/, and of course,
    we will look at them from the point of view of the Scala programming
    language. We will go through the following topics:

    + *What* are /creational design patterns/

    + The /factory method/

    + The /abstract factory/

    + Other /factory design patterns/

    + /Lazy initialization/

    + The /singleton/

    + The /builder/

    + The /prototype/

** What are creational design patterns?
   - Creational Design Patterns :: the design patterns deal with /object creation/.

   - Creating objects could involve some extra complexities,
     and
     /creational design patterns/ *hide these complexities* IN ORDER TO *make the
     use of software components easier.*

   - The object creation complexity could be _caused by_ any of the following:
     + The *number* of initialization parameters

     + Required *validation*

     + The complexity of *acquiring* the required parameters

     This list can be expanded, and these factors are present NOT just
     individually, but in combinations.

* TODO 8. Behavioral Design Patterns - Part One
  - There are more members in this group than the others we've already been through,
    so we will split it into two separate parts.

  - We'll focus on the following /behavioral design patterns/:
    + Value object
    + Null object
    + Strategy object
    + Command
    + Chain of responsibility
    + Interpreter

  - This and next chapters will give some clarity about
    + What behavioral design patterns are?
    + Where they are useful?
    + How to implement them in Scala?

** DONE Defining behavioral design patterns
   CLOSED: [2019-08-19 Mon 10:58]
   - CONTRARY TO /creational and structural design patterns/,
     the /behavioral design patterns/ describe a *flow* or a *process*.

   - This means that a developer should be really familiar with the actual process
     they are trying to implement.

   - As with every other type of design pattern,
     /behavioral design patterns/ exist in order to _increase_ the

    - Java (till Java 12) has NO built-in support for /value objects/.
      + The Java way used to simulate /value objects/:
        * Declare the /fields/ as ~final~;
        * Implement the ~hashCode~ and ~equals~ /methods/.

    - Scala can use /case classes/ (no ~var~ definitions) and /tuples/ to represent
      /value objects/.

    - /Tuples'/ *availability* for /value object pattern/:
      /Tuples/ can be an alternative if the number of fields are less than 22 --
      the limitation of built-in tuple classes (=from Jian= will be changed in
      Scala 3).

    - Shorthands:
      + Two n-tuples can be considered equal, even if semantically they are different
        types of objects.
        * =from Jian=
          A shorthand is NOT always a shorthand in all scenarios!!!
          _Shapeless_ is exploiting this "shorthand" and push /generic programming/
          to a new level.

      + /Case classes/ has a better readability than /tuples/!
        Everyone will prefer ~date.year~ rather han ~date._1~.
        * =from Jian=
          Use /2-tuple/ or /3-tuple/ in localized code snippets is OK.
          _But_ localized ONLY! _Because_ this way of using it doesn't resolve the
          first shorthand mentioned above.

        * =from Jian=
          Sometimes this shorthand can be walkarounded by ~import date.year~.
            However, this is not always the way you want to use it, and /case
          class objects/ can also do this.

    There is no other major drawbacks to using this pattern
    other than using /n-tuples/, which has a big n and is used nonlocal to

** TODO The null object design pattern
   - The purpose of the /null object design pattern/ is to
     define an *actual object* that represents the /null value/ and *has neutral
     behavior*.
     + This right /null object design pattern/ should also remove the _EXPLICIT
       null checks_, but _AUTOMATICALLY ENFORCE an implicit null check_, which can
