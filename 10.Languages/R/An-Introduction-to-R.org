* 2 Simple manipulations; numbers and vectors - 7
** DONE 2.1 Vectors and assignment - 7
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 14:45]
   - Create a vector with the ~c(elements...)~ function.
     ~c~ will flatten the arguments passed in if needed.

   - In most contexts the ~=~ operator can be used as an alternative.
     =from Jian=
     *But DO NOT do this!!!*
     I still don't know the reason.

   - The ~<-~ can be considered as a syntactic sugar of 
     ~assign("x", a_value)~

   - Both ~<-~ and ~->~ mean /assignment/.
     #+begin_src r
       c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1) -> x
     #+end_src

** DONE 2.2 Vector arithmetic - 7
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 14:58]
   - Write vector arithmetic as writing number arithmetic.

   - R will fill in values when the vectors in vector arithmetic does NOT match
     the required.
     =from Jian=
     Book describes rules, but I don't want to learn.
       Avoid this behavior!!! Good news is when this happen, a WARNING message
     will be printed.

   - Operators ~+~, ~-~, ~*~, ~/~, and ~^~

   - Functions ~log~, ~exp~, ~sin~, ~cos~, ~tan~, ~sqrt~, and so on.

   - ~mean()~ TODO

   - ~var()~ TODO

   - ~sort()~ TODO

   - ~min~ and ~max~ will flat their parameters if needed before comparing.

   - ~pmin~ and ~pmax~ won't flat their parameters, and it will return a vector
     with min of max of corresponding position values.
     =from Jian= The returned value is of the longest vector length

   - Complex numbers are supported, but must be explicitly point out!!!
     + ~sqrt(-17)~ will return ~NaN~.
     + ~sqrt(-17+0i)~ will return the expected complex value.
   
** DONE 2.3 Generating regular sequences - 8
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 15:07]
   - Use the ~:~ operator to generate a sequence of numbers.
     + ~:~ has a high precedence. Evaludate ~2 * 1:3~, and get ~c(2, 4, 6)~.
     + ~:~ can be used to generate a sequence backwards.

   - A more general function ~seq()~:
     It has five arguments:
     + ~from~
     + ~to~
     + ~by~, by default ~1~
     + ~length~
     + ~along~ TODO ???

   - ~rep()~
     Example:
     #+begin_src r
       # Put 5 `x` end-to-end
       s5 <- rep(x, times = 5)
       # Caution: x will be flatten if needed.

       # Repeat each element in `x` 5 times
       s6 <- rep(x, each = 5)
     #+end_src

** DONE 2.4 Logical vectors - 9
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 15:13]
   Logical quantities: ~TRUE~, ~FALSE~, and ~NA~.

   - ~T~ and ~F~ are built-in values pointed to ~TRUE~ and ~FALSE~, respectively.
     However, they are not reserved, and can be overwritten by a user.
     *You _should never ever_ use ~T~ and ~F~!!!*

   - ~<~, ~<=~, ~>~, ~>=~, ~==~, and ~!=~.

   - ~!~, ~&~, and ~|~

   - There are situations where logical vectors and their coerced numeric counterparts
     are not equivalent, for example see the next subsection
     TODO TODO TODO.

** DONE 2.5 Missing values - 9
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 15:17]
   - ~is.na()~ function.

   - ~is.na(x)~ is ~TRUE~ when ~x~ is ~NA~ or ~NaN~.

   - ~is.nan(x)~ is ~TRUE~ ONLY when ~x~ is ~NaN~.

   - TODO NOTE

** TODO 2.6 Character vectors - 10
** DONE 2.7 Index vectors; selecting and modifying subsets of a data set - 10
   CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 00:25]
   - Index vectors can be any of four distinct types:
     + A logical vector ::
       =from Jian= predicate
       ~y <- x[!is.na(x)]~

     + A vector of positive integral quantities :: Select these elements
       ~y <- x[-(1:5)]~

     + A vector of negative integral quantities :: Exclude these elements
       ~y <- x[-(1:5)]~

     + A vector of character strings :: Given each index a name of string.
       #+begin_src r
         fruit <- c(5, 10, 1, 20)
         names(fruit) <- c("organge", "banana", "apple", "peach")
         lunch <- fruit[c("apple", "organge")]
       #+end_src
       TODO This option is particularly useful in connection with /data frames/,
       as we shall see later.

   - Use index vector in receiving end:
     #+begin_src r
       x[is.na(x)] <- 0

       y[y < 0] <- -y[y < 0]
       # This is the same as `y <- abs(y)`
     #+end_src

** DONE 2.8 Other types of objects - 11
   CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 00:28]
   - /matrices/
   - /factors/
   - /lists/
   - /data frames/
   - /functions/

* DONE 3 Objects, their modes and attributes - 13
  CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 02:14]
** DONE 3.1 Intrinsic attributes: mode and length - 13
   CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 01:45]
   - _The entities R operates on_ are technically known as /objects/.

   - TODO: some other details

   - Five /modes/:
     + /numeric/
     + /complex/
     + /logical/
     + /character/
     + /raw/

   - /Mode/ and /length/ are called "intrinsic attributes" of an /object/.

   - ~mode~, ~length~, ~attributes~

   - There are multiple ~NA~'s with differnt /modes/.
     However, we just don't need to pay attention on this, and we often can't
     fill this.

** DONE 3.2 Changing the length of an object - 14
   CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 01:45]
   - Create *empty* /objects/:
     #+begin_src r
       c <- character()

       e <- numeric()
     #+end_src

   - Add elememt(s) of the _right_ /mode/ to an /object/ can chnage its length
     (remember ~e~ is of numeric mode. It is created in the last entry, and it
     is empty):
     #+begin_src r
       e[3] <- 17

       # Result:
       # `e` equals [NA, NA, 17]
     #+end_src

   - Ways of *shrink* an /object/:
     + selection some elements:
       ~alpha <- alpha[2 * 1:5]~

     + Provide wanted a length:
       ~length(alpha) <- 3~

** DONE 3.3 Getting and setting attributes - 14
   CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 02:00]
   - There are two functions:
     + ~attributes(object)~ returns a list of all the non-intrinsic attributes
       currently defined for that /object/.

     + ~attr(object, name)~ can be ued to select a specific attribute.

   - Example:
     ~attr(z, "dim") <- c(10, 10)~
     Allow R to treat ~z~ as if it were a 10-by-10 matrix.

** DONE 3.4 The class of an object - 14
   CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 02:14]
   *All /objects/ in R have a /class/, reported by the function ~class~.*

   - For _simple_ vectors, the /class/ is the same as its /mode/.
     However, there are other possible values like
     + "matrix"
     + "array"
     + "factor"
     + "data.frame"

   - ~class~ can be used in oo style of programming in R.
     For example, ~plot()~ function is sensitive to the ~class~.

   - Use ~unclass()~ to temporarily remove the effects of /class/.
     For exmaple, assume ~winter~ is a ~data.frame~, do ~unclass(winter)~, and
     print it, it won't how a ~data.frame~ style output.

** 4.1 A specific example - 16
** 4.2 The function ~tapply()~ and ragged arrays - 16
** 4.3 Ordered factors - 17

* 5 Arrays and matrices - 18
** DONE 5.1 Arrays - 18
   CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 02:40]
   - dimention vector :: a vector of non-negative integers.
     Its length is ~k~ then the array is k-dimensional.
     Example: a matrix is a 2-dimensional array.

   - Assume ~z~ is a /vector/.
     It can be made as an array by assigning a /dimension vector/ to it:
     ~dim(z) <- c(3, 5, 100)~

   - /Arrays/ can be one-dimensional. Then they are treated in the same way as
     /vectors/, TODO but the exceptions can cause confusion.
