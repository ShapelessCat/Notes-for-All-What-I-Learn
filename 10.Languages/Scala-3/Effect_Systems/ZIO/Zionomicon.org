  CLOSED: [2021-07-11 Sun 02:13]
  - This chapter will teach you the critical theory you need to understand and
    build _ZIO applications_.

    * We will start by introducing the CORE /data type/ in ZIO, which is called a
      /functional effect type/, and
    
    * define /functional effects/ as blueprints for concurrent workflows.
    
    * We will LEARN how to *combine effects sequentially,* and see how this allows
      us to refactor legacy code to ZIO.

    * We will DISCUSS the meaning of each of the /type parameters/ in _ZIO's core data
      type_, particularly
      + the /error type/ and
      + the /environment type/,
      which are features unique to ZIO.

    * We will _COMPARE_ ZIO to the ~Future~ data type in the Scala standard library,
      to clarify the concepts we introduce.

    * We will SEE
      how /ZIO environment/ lets us leverage the _testable services_ built into
      ZIO for interacting with _time_, the _console_, and _system information_ (among
      others).
      
    * Finally, we'll SEE
      how /recursive ZIO effects/ allow us to
      + *loop* and
      + perform other control flow operations.

  - By the end of this chapter,
    * you will be able to *write* _basic programs_ using ZIO, including those that
      leverage /environmental effects/ and /custom control flow operators/, and

    * you will be able to *refactor* legacy code to ZIO by following some simple
      guidelines.

** TODO 2.1 Functional Effects As Blueprints - 28
   The _core data type_ in the _ZIO library_ is ~ZIO[R, E, A]~, and values of
   this type are called /functional effects/.

   - A /functional effect/ is a kind of *blueprint* for a /concurrent workflow/.

   - A /functional effect/ of type ~ZIO[R, E, A]~ requires:
     * ~R~: /environment/ of the effect
     * ~E~: /error type/
     * ~A~: /success type/

** DONE 2.2 Sequential Composition - 31
   CLOSED: [2021-07-08 Thu 13:01]
   #+begin_src scala
     trait ZIO[R, E, A] {
       // ...
       def flatMap[B](andThen: A => ZIO[R, E, B]): ZIO[R, E, B] = ...
       // ...
     }
   #+end_src

   - Using this ~for~ /sequential operator/, we can describe a simple workflow
     that readers user input and then displays the input back to the user, as
     shown in the following snippet:
     #+begin_src scala
       import scala.io.StdIn
       
       val readLine =
         ZIO.effect(StdIn.readLine())
       
       def printLine(line: String) =
         ZIO.effect(println(line))
       
       val echo =
         readLine.flatMap(printLine)
     #+end_src

   - The ~flatMap~ operator is _FUNDAMENTAL_
     because it captures the way statements are executed in a _procedural
     program_: later statements *depend on* results computed by previous statements,
     which is exactly the relationship that ~flatMap~ describes.
     
   - For reference, here is th above program written in a _procedural style_:
     #+begin_src scala
       val line = Console.readLine()
       Console.println(line)
     #+end_src
     This relationship between _procedural programming_ and the ~flatMap~
     operator is so precise,
     we can actually *translate* any _procedural program_ into ZIO
     *by wrapping each statement in a constructor like ~ZIO.effect~ and then
     gluing the statements together using ~flatMap~.*
     * Example (translation):
       #+begin_src scala
         val data = doQuery(query)
         val response = generateResponse(data)
         writeResponse(response)
       #+end_src

       can be translated into ZIO as follows:
       #+begin_src scala
         ZIO.effect(doQuery(query)).flatMap { data =>
           ZIO.effect(generateResponse(data)).flatMap { response =>
             ZIO.effect(writeResponse(response))
           }
         }
       #+end_src
     
*** DONE 2.2.1 For Comprehensions - 32
    CLOSED: [2021-07-08 Thu 13:01]
    - A ~for~ /comprehension/ with *n* lines is translated by Scala into
      * *n - 1* calls to ~flatMap~ methods on the /effects/,
      * followed by a _final call_ to a ~map~ method on the last effect.

    - Example:
      #+begin_src scala
        for {
          x <- doA
          y <- doB(x)
          z <- doC(x, y)
        } yield x + y + z
      #+end_src

      will be translated into:
      #+begin_src scala
        doA.flatMap { x =>
          doB(x).flatMap { y =>
            doC(x, y).map(z => x + y + z)
          }
        }
      #+end_src
    
** DONE 2.3 Other Sequential Operators - 33
   CLOSED: [2021-07-08 Thu 13:34]
   /Sequential composition/ is so common when using /functional effects/, ZIO
   provides a variety of related operators for common needs.

   - ~zipWith~, ~zipLeft~ / ~<*~, and ~zipRight~ / ~*>~.

   - ~foreach~ and ~combineAll~

** DONE 2.4 ZIO Type Parameters - 35
   CLOSED: [2021-07-09 Fri 18:09]
   - ~ZIO[R, E, A]~ /type parameters/:
     * ~R~ is the /environment/ required for the effect to be executed.
       This could include
       + any /dependencies/ the effect has,
         for example access to a database or a logging service, or
       + an effect might _NOT require any /environment/,_ in which case, the
         /type parameter/ will be ~Any~.

     * ~E~ is the type of value that the effect _can FAIL with_.
       + This could be ~Throwable~ or ~Exception~,
         but it could also be a /domain-specific error type/, or
       + an effect might _not be able to fail at all_, in which case the /type
         parameter/ will be ~Nothing~.

     * ~A~ is the type of value that the effect _can SUCCEED with_.
       It can be thought of as the /return value/ or /output of the effect/.

   - If *NOT* considering the /concurrent/, /async/ or /resource-safe/,
     ~ZIO[R, E, A]~ is similar to ~R => Either[E, A]~.
     _It is a useful mental model._
     * The following snippet of code defines this *TOY model* of a /ZIO effect/:
       #+begin_src scala
         final case class ZIO[-R, +E, +A](run: R => Either[E, A])
       #+end_src

   - _Use mental model to implement some basic constructors and operators:_
     #+begin_src scala

         def map[B](f: A => B): ZIO[R, E, B] =
           ZIO(r => self.run(r).map(f))
       
         def flatMap[R1 <: R, E1 >: E, B](
           f: A => ZIO[R1, E1, B]

         def fail[E](e: => E): ZIO[Any, E, Nothing] =
           ZIO(_ => Left(e))
       }
     #+end_src

        something with it) and

        that needs one, so it doesn't need anything else).

** DONE 2.5 ZIO Type Aliases - 39
   CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 02:23]
   - With its /THREE type parameters/ ZIO is extremely powerful.
     * We can use the /environment type parameter/ to
       *propagate information DOWNWARD* in our program (databases, connection
       pools, configuration, and much more), and

     * we can use the /error and success type parameters/ to
       *propagate information UPWARD*.

   - Aliases:
     #+begin_src scala
       type IO[+E, +A]   = ZIO[Any, E, A]
       type Task[+A]     = ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]

   - Several other data types in _ZIO_ and _other libraries in the ZIO ecosystem_

** DONE 2.6 Comparison to Future - 40
   CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 03:35]
   We will discuss other differences between ~ZIO~ and ~Future~ later in this
   book when we discuss /concurrency/, _BUT_ for now there are *THREE primary
   differences* to keep in mind.

*** DONE 2.6.1 A ~Future~ Is A Running effect - 40
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 03:07]
    - Unlike a _functional effect_ like ~ZIO~,
      a ~Future~ models a _running effect_.

    - Snippet:
      #+begin_src scala
        import scala.concurrent.Future
        import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
        
        val goShoppingFuture: Future[Unit] =
          Future(println("Going to the grocery store"))
      #+end_src
      * As soon as ~goShoppingFuture~ is defined this effect will begin executing.
        ~Future~ _does *NOT* suspend evaluation of code wrapped in it._

    - =TODO= =RE-NOTE=
    - Because of this *tangling* between the _WHAT_ and the _HOW_,
      we don't have much power when using ~Future~.
      * For example,
        it would be nice to be able to define a _delay operator_ on ~Future~,
        just like we have for ZIO. _BUT_ we *can't* do that because it would be a
        method on ~Future~, and if we have a ~Future~, then it is *already
        running*, so it's *TOO LATE to delay it.*

    - Similarly, we *can't retry* a ~Future~ in the event of _failure_, like we
      can for ~ZIO~, because a ~Future~ *isn't* a blueprint for doing something --
      it's an executing computation.
        So if a ~Future~ _fails_, there is nothing else to do. We can ONLY
      *retrieve* the _failure_.

    - In contrast, since a /ZIO effect/ is a BLUEPRINT for a /concurrent workflow/,
      if we execute the effect once and it fails, we can always try executing it
      again, or executing it as many times as we would like.

    - This is the reason why ~ZIO~ doesn't need an /execution context/ like the
      ~ExecutionContext~ for ~Future~. To run a effect, ~ZIO~ need an
      ~Executor~, mostly any ~Executor~.
      * later we will see how you can “lock” an effect to run in a *specific*
        /execution context/, for those rare cases where you need to be explicit
        about this

*** DONE 2.6.2 ~Future~ Has An Error Type Fixed To ~Throwable~ - 42
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 03:32]
    ~Future~ has an /error type/ _fixed to_ ~Throwable~.
    It has *much less expressive power* than a /polymorphic error type/.

    - Illustration by examples:
      #+begin_src scala
        def parseInt: Future[Int] =
          ???
            
        def parseIntOrZero: Future[Int] =
          parseInt.fallBackTo(Future.successful(0))
      #+end_src
      * For the ~parseInt~,
        *we have no idea*
        _how this future can fail by looking at the type signature._
        + Could it return a ~NumberFormatException~ from parsing?
        + Could it return an ~IOException~?
        + Could it *not fail at all* because it handles its own errors, perhaps
          by retrying until the user entered a valid integer?
        We just don't know, not unless we dig into the code and study it at
        length.

      * This problem is especially annoying
        WHEN we handle all possible failure scenarios of a ~Future~,
        *BUT _nothing changes_ about the /type/.*

        + For the ~parseIntOrZero~, there is *no possible to know it can't fail*
          -- the /type signature/ doesn't tell us this. As far as the /type
          signature/ is concerned, this method could fail in _infinitely many
          ways_, just like ~parseInt~!

          - From the perspective of the /compiler/, ~fallBackTo~ *hasn't* changed
            anything about the fallibility of the ~Future~.
              In contrast, in ZIO ~parseInt~ would have a type of
            ~IO[NumberFormatException, Int]~, and ~parseIntOrZero~ would have a
            type of ~UIO[Int]~, indicating precisely _how ~parseInt~ *can* fail_
            and _that ~parseIntOrZero~ *cannot* fail_.

*** DONE 2.6.3 ~Future~ Does Not Have A Way To Model The Dependencies Of An Effect - 43
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 03:35]
    ZIO has direct support for /dependency injection/, but ~Future~ does *not*.
    =TODO= In later chapters

    - This means that in practice, *most* ~Future~ code in the real world is
      *NOT very testable*, because it requires too much _plumbing_ and
      _boilerplate_.
    
** DONE 2.7 More Effect Constructors - 43
   CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 23:32]
   - The ~ZIO.effect~ /constructor/ is a useful and common effect constructor,
     BUT it's *NOT suitable* for every scenario:
     * _Fallible_:
       Since the ~ZIO.effect~ /constructor/ returns an effect that can fail
       with any kind of ~Throwable~ (~ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]~).
       + *RIGHT choice*
         WHEN you are converting _legacy code_ into ZIO and don't know if it
         throws /excpetions/.

       + *BUT sometimes*, we know that some code *DOESN'T* throw /exceptions/.

     * _Synchronous_:
       The ~ZIO.effect~ /constructor/ requires that our _procedural code_ be
       /synchronous/, returning some value of the specified type from the
       captured block of code.
         But in an /asynchronous/ API, we have to register a callback to be
       invoked when a value of type ~A~ is available.
       _How do we *convert* /asynchronous/ code *to* /ZIO effects/?_

     * _Unwrapped_:
       The ~ZIO.effect~ /constructor/ *ASSUMES* the value we are computing is
       NOT wrapped in yet another data type, which has its own way of modeling
       failure.
         But some of the code that we interact with return an ~Option[A]~, an
       ~Either[E, A]~, a ~Try[A]~, or even a ~Future[A]~.
       _How do we convert from these types into /ZIO effects/?_

   - Fortunately,
     ZIO comes with robust constructors that handle
     * custom failure scenarios,
     * asynchronous code, and
     * other common data types.

*** DONE 2.7.1 Pure Versus Impure Values - 44
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 04:19]
    - /referential transparency/

    - ZIO tries to do the right thing even if you accidentally treat
      side-effecting code as pure code.
        But *mixing side-effecting code with ZIO code can be a source of bugs,*
      so it is best to be careful about using the RIGHT /effect constructor/. As
      a side benefit, this will make your code easier to read and review for
      your colleagues.

*** DONE 2.7.2 Effect Constructors For Pure Computations - 45
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 04:35]
    - In addition, even _pure code_ can benefit from some features of ZIO,
      such as /environment/, /typed errors/, and /stack safety/.

    - The _TWO most basic ways_ to convert /pure values/ into /ZIO effects/ are
      ~succeed~ and ~fail~:
      #+begin_src scala
        object ZIO {
          def fail[E](e: => E): ZIO[Any, E, Nothing] = ???
        
          def succeed[A](a: => A): ZIO[Any, Nothing, A] = ???
        }
      #+end_src
      * The ~ZIO.succeed~ /constructor/ converts a value into an effect that
        _succeeds_ with that value. The effects created with this constructor
        *cannot fail*.

      * The ~ZIO.fail~ /constructor/ converts a value into an effect that
        _fails_ with that value.
          For example, ~ZIO.fail(new Exception)~ construct an effect that fails
        with the specified exception. The /success type/ of the effect returned
        by ~ZIO.fail~ is ~Nothing~, because effects created with this
        constructor *cannot succeed*.

    - There are a variety of _OTHER_ /constructors/ that can
      *convert* /standard Scala data types/ *into* /ZIO effects/.
      #+begin_src scala
        import scala.util.Try
        
        object ZIO {
          def fromEither[E, A](eea: => Either[E, A]): IO[E, A] = ???
        
          def fromOption[A](oa: => Option[A]): IO[None.type, A] = ???
        
          def fromTry[A](oa: => Try[A]): Task[A] = ???
        }
      #+end_src

    - These are *NOT the only* /effect constructors/ for /pure values/.
      =TODO=
      In the exercises at the end of this chapter, you will explore a few of the
      _OTHER_ constructors.

    The *most important* /effect constructors/ are those for side-effecting
    computations.
      These constructors *convert* /procedural code/ *into* /ZIO effects/, so
    they become blueprints that _SEPARATE the WHAT from the HOW._

    - Earlier in this chapter, we introduced ~ZIO.effect~.
      This constructor
      * *captures* side-effecting code, and
      * *defers* its evaluation until later,
        _translating_ any /exceptions/ thrown in the code into ~ZIO.fail~ values.

    - Sometimes, however, we want to convert _side-effecting code_ into a /ZIO
      effect/, but we know the _side-effecting code_ does *NOT throw* any
      /exceptions/.
        For example, checking the system time or generating a random variable
      are definitely side-effects, but they *cannot throw* /exceptions/.
      * For these cases, we can use the /constructor/ ~ZIO.effectTotal~, which
        converts /procedural code/ into a /ZIO effect/ that _CANNOT fail_:
        #+begin_src scala
          object ZIO {
            def effectTotal[A](a: => A): ZIO[Any, Nothing, A]
          }

   - ZIO provides _four to five_ different default services for ALL applications,
     depending on the platform:
     1. *Clock*.
        Provides functionality related to *time and scheduling*.
          If you are accessing the current time or scheduling a computation to
        occur at some point in the future you are using this.

     2. *Console*.
        Provides functionality related to *console input and output*.

     3. *System*.
        Provides functionality for getting *system and environment variables*.

     4. *Random*.
        Provides functionality for generating *random values*.

     5. *Blocking*.
        Provides functionality for running blocking tasks on a separate
        ~Executor~ optimized for these kinds of workloads.
        * Because blocking is *not supported* on _Scala.js_,
          this service is *only available* on the _JVM_.

*** DONE 2.8.1 Clock - 51
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 21:08]
    The ~Clock~ service provides functionality related to *Time and Scheduling*.

    - This includes several methods to obtain the _current time_ in different
      ways
      * ~currentTime~ to return the _current time_ in the specified ~TimeUnit~,
      * ~currentDateTime~ to return the _current_ ~OffsetDateTime~, and
      * ~nanoTime~ to obtain the _current time_ in nanoseconds.

    - The ~Clock~ service includes a ~sleep~ /method/,
      which can be used to sleep for a certain amount of time.

    - The signature of ~nanoTime~ and ~sleep~ are shown in the following snippet:
      #+begin_src scala
        import zio.duration._
        
        package object clock {
          def nanoTime: URIO[Clock, Long]
        
          def sleep(duration: => Duration): URIO[Clock, Unit]
        }
      #+end_src
      * This ~sleep~ is /nonblocking/, so it doesn't actually consume any /threads/
        while it is waiting for the time to elapse.
        =TODO= =???=
        =TODO= =???=

          import zio.clock._
          import zio.duration._
          
          def delay[R, E, A](zio: ZIO[R, E, A])(
            duration: Duration
          ): ZIO[R with Clock, E, A] =
            clock.sleep(duration) *> zio
        #+end_src

    - The ~Clock~ service is the building block for *ALL time and scheduling
      functionality in ZIO.*
        Consequently, you will see the ~Clock~ service as a component of the
      /environment/ whenever working with
      * retrying,
      * repetition,
      * timing, or
      * other features related to /time/ and /scheduling/ built into ZIO.

*** DONE 2.8.2 Console - 52
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 22:58]
    The ~Console~ service provides functionality around
    *reading* from and *writing* to the /console/.

    - =from Jian= _EXPLAIN why we didn't use ~Console~ until here:_
      *So far* in this book, we have been interacting with the /console/ by
      converting /procedural code/ in the Scala library to ZIO effects, using the
      ~ZIO.effect~ /constructor/.
        This was useful to illustrate how to translate procedural to ZIO, and
      demonstrate there is no “magic” in ZIO's own console facilities.
      * *However*,
        _WRAPPING console functionality DIRECTLY_ is *not ideal*,
        because we cannot provide alternative implementations for /testing
        environments/.
          In addition, there are some tricky edge corner cases for console
        interaction that *the ~Console~ services handles for us.* (For example,
        reading from the console can _fail ONLY with_ an ~IOException~.)

    - The key /methods/ on the ~Console~ service:
      #+begin_src scala
        package object console {
          val getStrLn: ZIO[Console IOExcception, String]
          def putStr(line: => String): URIO[Console, Unit]
          def putStrLn(line: => String): URIO[Console, Unit]
        }
      #+end_src

    - USAGE:
      The ~Console~ service is commonly used in console applications, but is *less
      common* in generic code than ~Clock~ or ~Random~.
        In the rest of this book, we will illustrate examples involving _console
      applications_ with these /methods/, *RATHER THAN converting /methods/ from
      the Scala standard library.*

*** DONE 2.8.3 System - 52
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 23:06]
    The ~System~ service provides functionality to get *system and environment
    variables*.

    - The two main /methods/ on the ~System~ service
      #+begin_src scala
        package object system {
          def env(variable: String): IO[SecurityException, Option[String]]
          def property(prop: String): IO[Throwable, Option[String]]
        }
      #+end_src
      =FIXME= A missing closing curly brace.
      * ~env~, which accesses a specified /environment variable/
      * ~property~, which accesses a specified /system property/

    - There are also other variants for
      * *obtaining* all /environment variables/ or /system properties/, or
      * *specifying* a /backup value/, if a specified /environment variable/ or
        /property/ does _NOT exist_.

    - USAGE:
      Like the ~Console~ service, the ~System~ service tends to be used more in
      _applications_ or _certain libraries_ (e.g. those dealing with configuration)
      BUT is uncommon in generic code.

*** DONE 2.8.4 Random - 53
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 05:10]
    ZIO ~Random~ service exposes essentially the *SAME interface* as
    ~scala.util.Random~, but all the /methods/ return /functional effects/.

    - The ~Random~ service is sometimes used in generic code in /scheduling/,
      such as when adding a random delay between recurrences of some /effect/.

*** DONE 2.8.5 Blocking - 53
    CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 23:32]
    The ~Blocking~ service supports running blocking effects on an ~Executor~
    optimized for /blocking tasks/.
      By default, the /ZIO runtime/ is *optimized for* /asynchronous and
    computationally-bound tasks/, with _a small fixed number of /threads/ that
    perform all work._
      Although this choice *optimizes throughput* for /async/ and /CPU tasks/,
    it means that you *could potentially exhaust ALL* of /ZIO's default threads/
    if you run _blocking I/O operations_ on them. Therefore, it is critical
    that /blocking tasks/ be run on a SEPARATE /blocking thread pool/, which
    is optimized for these workloads.

    - The ~Blocking~ service has several /methods/ to support this use case.
        The most fundamental is the ~blocking~ operator, which takes an effect
      and ensures it will be run on the /blocking thread pool/.
      #+begin_src scala
        import zio.blocking._
        
        object blocking {
          def blocking[R <: Blocking, E, A](
            zio: ZIO[R, E, A]
          ): ZIO[R, E, A] = ???
        }
      #+end_src

    - Let's say that the database query described above was not implemented in
      terms of a callback based API but instead synchronously waited until the
      result was available (thereby blocking the calling thread).
        In this case, we would want to make sure the effect is executed on the
      /blocking thread pool/ by using the ~blocking~ operator, as shown in the
      following snippet:
      #+begin_src scala
        import zio.blocking._
        
        def getUserById(id: Int): IO[Unit, String] =
          ???
        
        def getUserByIdBlocking(id: Int): ZIO[Blocking, Unit, String] =
          blocking(getUserById(id))
      #+end_src
      Notice that the ~Blocking~ service is now a _dependency_ in the /type
      signature/, clarifying that the returned effect involves /blocking IO/, in
      a way its previous signature did not.

    - If you want to
      _construct an /effect/ from a /blocking side-effect/ DIRECTLY_,
      you can use the ~effectBlocking~ /constructor/, which is equivalent to
      ~blocking(ZIO.effect(...))~.
    
** DONE 2.9 Recursion And ZIO - 54
   CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 05:06]
   One of the features of ZIO is that *ZIO effects are _stack-safe_ for
   arbitrarily recursive effects.* So we can write ZIO functions that call
   themselves to implement any kind of recursive logic with ZIO.

   - Example:
     #+begin_src scala
       import zio.console._
       
       val readInt: RIO[Console, Int] =
         for {
           line <- console.getStrLn
           int  <- ZIO.effect(line.toInt)
         } yield int
     #+end_src
     =FIXME=
     The ~int~ is highlighted in the book, and it shouldn't -- no need to
     highlight the ~int~ in Scala code snippets.

     #+begin_src scala
       lazy val readIntOrRetry: URIO[Console, Int] =
         readInt
           .orElse {
             console.putStrLn("Please enter a valid integer") *> readIntOrRetry
           }
     #+end_src
     Using recursion, we can _create our own sophisticated control flow
     constructs for our ZIO programs._

** DONE 2.10 Conclusion - 55
   CLOSED: [2021-07-10 Sat 23:44]
   - /Functional effects/ are blueprints for /concurrent workflows/,
     immutable values that offer a variety of operators for *transforming* and
     *combining* /effects/ to solve more complex problems.

   - The /ZIO type parameters/ allow us to
     * *model* /effects/ that require context from an /environment/ before they
       can be executed;

     * *model* /failure modes/ (or a lack of /failure modes/);

     * *describe* the /final successful result/ that will be computed by an
       /effect/.

   - ZIO offers a variety of ways to create /functional effects/
     from /synchronous/ code, /asynchronous/ code, /pure computations/, and
     /impure computations/.
       In addition, /ZIO effects/ can be *created from* other data types built
     into the Scala standard library.

   - ZIO uses the /environment type parameter/ to make it easy to write _testable
     code_ that interacts with interfaces, without the need to manually propagate
     those interfaces throughout the entire application.
     * Using this /type parameter/, ZIO ships with _standard services_ for
       interacting with the /console/, the /system/, /random number generation/,
       and a /blocking thread pool/.

   - With these tools, you should be able to write your own simple ZIO programs,
     * *convert* existing code you have written into ZIO using /effect constructors/,
       and leverage the functionality built *into* ZIO.

   The /ZIO error type/ allows us to see just by looking at the /type signature/
   all the ways that an /effect/ can fail.
     _But sometimes, a FAILURE can occur in a way that is *NOT supposed to happen*._

   - For example, here is a *NOT supposed to happen* FAILURE:

       val divisionByZero: UIO[Int] =
         UIO.effectTotal(1 / 0)

     * Errors :: potential failures that are *represented* in the /error type/ of
                 the /effect/.
       + They model FAILURE scenarios that are _anticipated_ and _potentially

     * Defects :: potential failures *NOT represented* in the /error type/ of the

   CLOSED: [2021-07-12 Mon 03:26]
   ZIO _formalizes_ this distinction between /failures/ and /defects/ using a
   /data type/ called ~Cause~.

   - So far, we have said that ~ZIO[R, E, A]~ is the type of effects that can
     potentially fail with an ~E~ or succeed with an ~A~. Now we can be more
     precise, and say that an effect of type ~ZIO[R, E, A]~ can potentially fail
     with a ~Cause[E]~ or succeed with an ~A~.

   - A ~Cause[E]~ is a /sealed trait/ that has *several* /subtypes/ that capture
     all possible failure scenarios for an /effect/.

   - For now, the most relevant subtypes are shown in the following snippet:
     #+begin_src scala
       sealed trait Cause[+E]
       object Cause {
         final case class Die(t: Throwable) extends Cause[Nothing]

   can finish execution.
     In particular, /effects/ of type ~ZIO[R, E, A]~ may
   EITHER _succeed_ with a value of type ~A~, OR _fail_ with a ~Cause[E]~.
   #+begin_src scala
     sealed trait Exit[+E, +A]
     object Exit {
       final case class Success[+A](value: A)        extends Exit[Nothing, A]
       final case class Failure[+E](cause: Cause[E]) extends Exit[E, Nothing]
     }
   #+end_src

   - Once we understand ~Cause~, ~Exit~ is a relatively simple data type.
     * It is equivalent to ~Either[Cause[E], A]~, which is the encoding we used
       in our _mental model of ZIO_ in the FIRST chapter
       + with ~E~ replaced by ~Cause[E]~ in the ~Left~ case.
         - Creating a separate /data type/ for ~Cause~ just *allows us to*
           provide useful /methods/ and clarifies what /THIS data type/
           represents in /type signatures/.

   - You will most commonly encounter ~Exit~ when working
     with some operators that *allow* you to do something with the _result of an
     /effect/._
     =TODO=
       We'll see more specific examples of this later, but for now, just be
     aware that this data type exists and understand that it represents all the
     ways a running ZIO effect can finish execution.

  This chapter begins our discussion of ZIO's support for /asynchronous/, /parallel/,
  and /concurrent programming/.

  - ZIO is _based on a model of_ /fibers/ so we will begin by learning
    _what /fibers/ are_ and
    _how they are different than /threads/._
    * We will learn the basic operations on /fibers/ including
      + *forking* them,
      + *joining* them, and
      + *interrupting* them.

    * We will also discuss
      + _ZIO's /fiber/ supervision model_ and
      + how it makes it easier for us to _write *SAFE* concurrent code._
