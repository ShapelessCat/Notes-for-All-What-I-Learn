* TODO 1. Introduction
  Style Guidelines
  TODO NOTE

  - *Guideline statuses*
    Every guideline has a status:
    + [FIXME]:
      Marks places where there is more work to be done. In some cases, that just
      means going through the RFC process.

    + [FIXME #NNNNN]:
      Like [FIXME], but links to the issue tracker.

    + [RFC #NNNN]:
      Marks accepted guidelines, linking to the rust-lang RFC establishing them.

  - *Guideline stabilization*

  - *What's in this document*
    + This document is broken into four parts:
      * *Style* provides a set of rules governing _naming conventions_, _whitespace_,
        and _other stylistic issues_.

      * *Guidelines by Rust feature* places the focus on each of Rust's features,
        starting from expressions and working the way out toward crates,
        dispensing guidelines relevant to each.

      * *Topical guidelines and patterns*. The rest of the document proceeds by
        cross-cutting topic, starting with _Ownership and resources_.

      * *APIs for a changing Rust* discusses the forward-compatibility hazards,
        especially those that interact with the pre-1.0 library stabilization
        process.

    + [FIXME]
      Add cross-references throughout this document to the tutorial, reference
      manual, and other guides.

    + [FIXME]
      What are some non-goals, non-principles, or anti-patterns that we should
      document?

* TODO 2. Style - _READING_
  This section gives a set of *STRICT rules* for styling Rust code.
  [FIXME] General remarks about the style guidelines

** DONE 2.1. Whitespace [FIXME: needs RFC]
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 02:34]
   - Lines must not exceed _99 characters_.

   - Use _4 spaces_ for indentation, _not tabs_.

   - _No trailing whitespace_ at the end of lines or files.

   - *Spaces*
     + Use spaces around binary operators, including the equals sign in attributes:
       #+begin_src rust
         #[deprecated = "Use `bar` instead."]
         fn foo(a: unit, b: unit) -> unit {
             a + b
         }
       #+end_src

     + Use a space after colons and commas:
       #+begin_src rust
         fn foo(a: Bar);

         MyStruct { foo: 3, bar: 4 }

         foo(bar, baz);
       #+end_src

     + Use a space after the opening and before the closing brace
       FOR *single line blocks or struct expressions*:
       #+begin_src rust
         spawn(proc() { do_something(); });

         Point { x: 0.1, y: 0.3 }
       #+end_src

   - Line wrapping
     + For _multiline_ /function signatures/, each new line _should align with the
       first parameter_. _Multiple parameters per line are permitted_:
       #+begin_src rust
         fn frobnicate(a: Bar, b: Bar,
                       c: Bar, d: Bar)
                       -> Bar {
             // ...
         }

         fn foo<T: This,
                U: That>(
                a: Bar,
                b: Bar)
                -> Baz {
             // ...
         }
       #+end_src

     + _Multiline_ /function invocations/ generally follow the _SAME rule_ as for
       /signatures/.
         However, if the final argument begins a new block,
       the contents of the block may begin on a new line, indented one level:
       #+begin_src rust
         fn foo_bar(a: Bar, b: Bar,
                    c: |Bar|) -> Bar {
             ...
         }
  
         // Same line is fine:
         foo_bar(x, y, |z| { z.transpose(y) });
  
         // Indented body on new line is also fine:
         foo_bar(x, y, |z| {
             z.quux();
             z.rotate(x)
         })
       #+end_src

     + [FIXME] Do we also want to allow the following?
       #+begin_src rust
         frobnicate(
             arg1,
             arg2,
             arg3)
       #+end_src
       This style could ease the conflict between
       _line length_ and _functions with many parameters (or long method chains)_.

*** DONE Matches
    CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 02:24]
    =from Jian= Current text in this subsection is +DEPRECATED+!

*** DONE Alignment
    CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 02:18]
    Idiomatic code *should _NOT_ use extra whitespace* in the middle of a line
    to provide alignment.
    #+begin_src rust
      // Good
      struct Foo {
          short: f64,
          really_long: f64,
      }

      // Bad
      struct Bar {
          short:       f64,
          really_long: f64,
      }

      // Good
      let a = 0;
      let radius = 7;

      // Bad
      let b        = 0;
      let diameter = 7;
    #+end_src

** DONE 2.2. Comments [FIXME: needs RFC]
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 02:58]
   - *Avoid block comments*
     Use line comments
     #+begin_src rust
       // Wait for the main thread to return, and set the process error code
       // appropriately.
     #+end_src

     Instead of 
     #+begin_src rust
       /*
        * Wait for the main thread to return, and set the process error code
        * appropriately.
        */
     #+end_src

   - *Doc comments*
     /Doc comments/ are prefixed by _three slashes (~///~)_ and indicate documentation
     that you would like to be included in Rustdoc's output.

     They _SUPPORT Markdown syntax_ and are the main way of documenting your
     public APIs.

     The supported markdown syntax includes all of the extensions listed in the
     [[https://help.github.com/en/categories/writing-on-github][GitHub Flavored Markdown]] documentation, plus superscripts.

     + Summary line 
       The *first line* in any doc comment should be a _single-line short
       sentence providing a summary of the code_.
         This line is used as a short summary description throughout Rustdoc's
       output, so it's a good idea to keep it short.

     + Sentence structure
       * Capital letter and end with punctuations.
       * Prefer full sentences to fragments.
       * The /summary line/ should be written in /third person singular present
         indicative form/. Basically, this means write "Returns" instead of "Return".
       * Example:
         #+begin_src rust
           /// Sets up a default runtime configuration, given compiler-supplied arguments.
           ///
           /// This function will block until the entire pool of M:N schedulers has
           /// exited. This function also requires a local thread to be available.
           ///
           /// # Arguments
           ///
           /// * `argc` & `argv` - The argument vector. On Unix this information is used
           ///                     by `os::args`.
           /// * `main` - The initial procedure to run inside of the M:N scheduling pool.
           ///            Once this procedure exits, the scheduling pool will begin to shut
           ///            down. The entire pool (and this function) will only return once
           ///            all child threads have finished executing.
           ///
           /// # Return value
           ///
           /// The return value is used as the process return code. 0 on success, 101 on
           /// error.
         #+end_src

     + Code snippets [FIXME]

   - Avoid /inner doc comments/
     Use /inner doc comments/ _ONLY_ to document /crates/ and /file-level modules/:
     #+begin_src rust
       //! The core library.
       //!
       //! The core library is a something something...
     #+end_src

** DONE 2.3. Braces, semicolons, commas [FIXME: needs RFC]
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 03:10]
   - *Opening braces always go on the same line*
     #+begin_src rust
       fn foo() {
           // ...
       }

       fn frobnicate(a: Bar, b: Bar,
                     c: Bar, d: Bar)
                     -> Bar {
           // ...
       }

       trait Bar {
           fn baz(&self);
       }

       impl Bar for Baz {
           fn baz(&self) {
               // ...
           }
       }

       frob(|x| {
           x.transpose()
       })
     #+end_src

   - ~match~ *arms get braces, except for single-line expressions*
     #+begin_src rust
       match foo {
           bar => baz,
           quux => {
               do_something();
               do_something_else()
           }
       }
     #+end_src

   - ~return~ *statements get semicolons*
     #+begin_src rust
       fn foo() {
           do_something();

           if condition() {
               return;
           }

           do_something_else();
       }
     #+end_src

   - Trailing commas
     [FIXME] We should have a guideline for when to include trailing commas in
     structs, matches, function calls, etc.

     One possible rule: a trailing comma should be included whenever the closing
     delimiter appears on a separate line:

** TODO 2.4. Naming
   Naming conventions
   - *General conventions [RFC #430]*

   - *Referring to types in function/method names [RFC 344]*
     TODO

   - *Avoid redundant prefixes [RFC 356]*
     Don't define ~FooError~ in ~mod foo~!
     You can use name ~Error~, though this is a very common name, the library
     clients can rename on import to avoid clashes.

   - *Getter/setter methods [RFC 344]*
     TODO

   - *Escape hatches [FIXME]*
     TODO

   - *Predicates*
     + _SIMPLE_ /boolean predicates/ should be _prefixed with_ ~is_~ or another
       short question word, e.g., ~is_empty~.

     + Common exceptions: ~lt~, ~gt~, and _other established predicate names_. TODO ???

*** TODO 2.4.2. Containers/wrappers
*** TODO 2.4.3. Conversions
*** TODO 2.4.4. Iterators

** DONE 2.5. Imports [FIXME: needs RFC]
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 03:27]
   - *Avoid ~use \star{}~, except in tests*
     ~use *~ They are *forwards-INCOMPATIBLE*,
     since new upstream exports can clash with existing names.

     + When writing a /test submodule/, importing ~super::*~ is appropriate as a
       convenience.

   - *Prefer _fully importing types/traits_ while _module-qualifying functions_.*
     For example:
     #+begin_src rust
       use option::Option;
       use mem;

       let i: int = mem::transmute(Option(0));
     #+end_src
     [FIXME] Add rationale.

** DONE 2.6. Organization [FIXME: needs RFC]
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 03:15]
   - [FIXME] What else?

   - Q :: *Reexport* the most important types _at the /crate level/._
   - A :: Crates ~pub~ use the most common types for convenience, so that clients
          do not have to remember or write the crate's module hierarchy to use
          these types.

   - Q :: Define /types/ and /operations/ *together*.
   - A :: /Type definitions/ and the _functions/methods_ that operate on them should
          be defined together *in a SINGLE /module/,* with
          _the /type/ appearing *above* the functions/methods._

  CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 02:11]
  [FIXME]
  - Add some general remarks about _when_ and _how_ to /unit test/, versus other
    kinds of testing.

  - What are our expectations for Rust's core libraries?

** TODO 7.1. Unit testing
   - /Unit tests/ should live in a /tests submodule/ *at the BOTTOM of _the /module/
     they test_.*

   - Mark the /tests submodule/ with ~#[cfg(test)]~ so it is _ONLY compiled WHEN
     testing_.

   - The ~tests~ /module/ should contain:
     + /Imports/ needed only for testing.

     + /Functions/ marked with ~#[test]~ _striving for full coverage_ of the parent
       module's definitions.

     + /Auxiliary functions/ needed for writing the tests.

   - Example:
     #+begin_src rust
       // Excerpt from std::str

       #[cfg(test)]
       mod tests {
           #[test]
