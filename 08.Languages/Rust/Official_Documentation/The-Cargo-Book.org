*Cargo is the /Rust package manager/.*

- Cargo
  1. _downloads_ your Rust package's dependencies,

  2. _compiles_ your packages

  3. _makes_ distributable packages, and
     _uploads_ them to _crates.io, the Rust community's package registry_.

- You can contribute to this book on GitHub.

* DONE 1. Getting Started
CLOSED: [2025-01-25 Sat 12:44]
To get started with Cargo, install Cargo (and Rust) and set up your first
/crate/.

** 1.1. Installation
*** Install Rust and Cargo
Through _rustup_
#+begin_src shell
  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
#+end_src

After this, use _rustup_ command to also install /channels/ you need.

*** Build and Install Cargo from Source
Alternatively, you can [[https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#compiling-from-source][build Cargo from source]].

** 1.2. First Steps with Cargo

* TODO 2. Cargo Guide - =TODO: NOTE=
The guide will give you all you need to know about
_how to use Cargo to develop Rust packages._

** 2.1. Why Cargo Exists
*** Preliminaries
- crate :: (In Rust) a library or executable program.

- /Crates/ are compiled using the Rust compiler, ~rustc~.

- Directly use ~rustc~ can be complex if many spedific compilation requirements
  exist.

- Furthermore, most non-trivial programs will likely have dependencies on
  /external libraries/, and will therefore also depend transitively on THEIR
  /dependencies/.
  =IMPORTANT=
  Obtaining the correct versions of all the necessary dependencies and keeping
  them up to date would be hard and error-prone if done by hand.

- =IMPORTANT=
  *Solution*:
  Rather than work only with /crates/ and ~rustc~, you can avoid the
  difficulties involved with performing the above tasks
  * by introducing a higher-level “package” abstraction and
  * by using a package manager.

*** Enter: Cargo
- _Cargo_ is /the Rust package manager/.

  It is a tool that
  * allows Rust packages to declare their various dependencies and
  * ensure (=FIXME: ensures=) that you'll always get _a REPEATABLE build_.

- To accomplish this goal, Cargo does four things:
  1. Introduces TWO metadata files with various bits of package information.
  2. Fetches and builds your package's dependencies.
  3. Invokes ~rustc~ or another build tool with the correct parameters to build
     your package.
  4. Introduces conventions to make working with Rust packages easier.

- To a large extent,

  1. Cargo _normalizes_ the commands needed to build a given program or library;
     this is one aspect to the above mentioned *CONVENTIONS*.

     As we show later, the same command can be used to build different
     artifacts, regardless of their names. Rather than invoke rustc directly,
     you can instead invoke something generic such as ~cargo build~ and let
     cargo worry about constructing the correct rustc invocation.

  2. Furthermore, Cargo will automatically fetch any dependencies you have
     defined for your artifact from a registry, and arrange for them to be added
     into your build as needed.

- =IMPORTANT=
  The best thing that can be promised about using tools like _Cargo_:
  It is only a slight exaggeration to say that once you know how to build one
  Cargo-based project, you know how to build all of them.
  * =from Jian=
    In contrast, when writing C/C++ you need to write Makefile or CMake related
    files, which doesn't have conventions as simple as Cargo's.
