* Introduction
- Rust is a modern systems programming language _FOCUSING ON_
  safety,
  speed, and
  concurrency.

  It accomplishes these goals by being *memory safe without using garbage
  collection*.

- /Rust by Example (RBE)/ is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate
  various Rust concepts and standard libraries.

- Now let's begin!
  * Hello World - Start with a traditional Hello World program.

  * Primitives - Learn about signed integers, unsigned integers and other
                 primitives.

  * Custom Types - ~struct~ and ~enum~.

  * Variable Bindings - mutable bindings, scope, shadowing.

  * Types - Learn about changing and defining types.

  * Conversion - Convert between different types, such as strings, integers, and
                 floats.

  * Expressions - Learn about Expressions & how to use them.

  * Flow of Control - ~if~ / ~else~, ~for~, and others.

  * Functions - Learn about Methods, Closures and Higher Order Functions.

  * Modules - Organize code using modules

  * Crates - A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. Learn to create a library.

  * Cargo - Go through some basic features of the official Rust package
            management tool.

  * Attributes - An attribute is metadata applied to some module, crate or item.

  * Generics - Learn about writing a function or data type which can work for
               multiple types of arguments.

  * Scoping rules - Scopes play an important part in ownership, borrowing, and
                    lifetimes.

  * Traits - A trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type:
             ~Self~

  * Macros - Macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which is
             known as metaprogramming.

  * Error handling - Learn Rust way of handling failures.

  * Std library types - Learn about some custom types provided by ~std~ library.

  * Std misc - More custom types for file handling, threads.

  * Testing - All sorts of testing in Rust.

  * Unsafe Operations - Learn about entering a block of unsafe operations.

  * Compatibility - Handling Rust's evolution and potential compatibility issues.

  * Meta - Documentation, Benchmarking.

* DONE 1. Hello World
CLOSED: [2024-09-28 Sat 21:57]
** DONE 1.1. Comments
CLOSED: [2024-09-28 Sat 15:11]
Any program requires comments, and Rust supports a few different varieties:

- Regular comments which are ignored by the compiler:
  * line comment:
    #+begin_src rust
      // Line comments which go to the end of the line.
    #+end_src

  * block comment:
    #+begin_src rust
      /* Block comments which go to the closing delimiter. */
    #+end_src

- Doc comments which are parsed into HTML library documentation:
  * Inner Documentation Comments:
    Document items such as functions, structs, enums, traits, etc.
    #+begin_src rust
      /// Generate library docs for the following item.
    #+end_src

  * Outer Documentation Comments:
    Document /modules/ or the /crate/ *as a whole*.
    #+begin_src rust
      //! Generate library docs for the enclosing item.
    #+end_src

** DONE 1.2. Formatted print
CLOSED: [2024-09-28 Sat 21:57]
- Printing is handled by a series of macros defined in ~std::fmt~ some of which
  are:
  * ~format!~: write formatted text to ~String~
  * ~print!~: same as ~format!~ but the text is printed to the console (~io::stdout~).
  * ~println!~: same as ~print!~ but a newline is appended.
  * ~eprint!~: same as ~print!~ but the text is printed to the standard error (~io::stderr~).
  * ~eprintln!~: same as ~eprint!~ but a newline is appended.

- ~std::fmt~ contains many /traits/ which govern _the display of text_.
  The base form of two important ones are listed below:
  * ~fmt::Debug~: Uses the ~{:?}~ marker.
    Format text for debugging purposes.

  * ~fmt::Display~: Uses the ~{}~ marker.
    Format text in a more elegant, user friendly fashion.

- Here, we used ~fmt::Display~ because the std library provides implementations for
  these types. To print text for custom types, more steps are required.

- Implementing the ~fmt::Display~ /trait/ *AUTOMATICALLY* implements the ~ToString~
  /trait/ which allows us to convert the type to ~String~.

- In line 43, ~#[allow(dead_code)]~ is an attribute which only applies to the
  /module/ after it.

**** Activities
**** See also

*** 1.2.1. ~Debug~
- _Automatic implementations_ are ONLY PROVIDED for types such as in the ~std~
  library. All others must be _MANUALLY implemented_ somehow.

- ~fmt::Display~ must be manually implemented.

- *ALL* ~std~ library types are automatically printable with ~{:?}~ too.

- So ~fmt::Debug~ definitely makes this printable but sacrifices some elegance.
  Rust also provides *"pretty printing"* with ~{:#?}~.

*** 1.2.2. ~Display~
- ~fmt::Display~ uses the ~{}~ marker.

- Since it is ambiguous about what is the ideal way to display some types, many types
  in ~std~ doesn't implement ~fmt::Display~.
  * ~fmt::Display~ is not implemented for any other generic containers.

- ~fmt::Binary~ uses the ~{:b}~ marker.

* DONE 2. Primitives
CLOSED: [2024-09-28 Sat 23:14]
*** Scalar Types
- Signed integers: ~i8~, ~i16~, ~i32~, ~i64~, ~i128~ and ~isize~ (pointer size)
- Unsigned integers: ~u8~, ~u16~, ~u32~, ~u64~, ~u128~ and ~usize~ (pointer size)
- Floating point: ~f32~, ~f64~
- ~char~ /Unicode scalar values/ like ~'a'~, ~'α'~ and ~'∞'~ (*4 bytes each*)
- ~bool~ either ~true~ or ~false~
- The /unit type/ ~()~, whose only possible value is an _empty tuple_: ~()~
  * Despite the value of a /unit type/ being a /tuple/, it is *NOT* considered a
    /compound type/ because it does not contain multiple values.

*** Compound Types
- Arrays like ~[1, 2, 3]~
- Tuples like ~(1, true)~

** DONE 2.1. Literals and operators
CLOSED: [2024-09-28 Sat 23:03]
- Prefixes for integer:
  * hexadecimal: ~0x~
  * octal: ~0o~
  * binary: ~0b~

CLOSED: [2024-09-28 Sat 23:05]
*** Activity

** DONE 2.3. Arrays and Slices
CLOSED: [2024-09-28 Sat 23:14]
- An /array/ is a collection of objects of the same type ~T~,
  stored in *contiguous memory*.
  * /Arrays/ are created using brackets ~[]~, and their _length_, which is *known
    at compile time*, is part of their /type signature/ ~[T; length]~.

- /Slices/ are _SIMILAR TO_ /arrays/, but their _length_ is *not known at compile
  time*.
  * Instead, a /slice/ is a _two-word object_:
    + the first word is a pointer to the data,
    + the second word is the length of the slice.
      - ~usize~, determined by the /processor architecture/, e.g. 64 bits on an
        x86-64.

  * /Slices/ can be used to borrow a section of an array and have the /type
    signature/ ~&[T]~.

* DONE 3. Custom Types
CLOSED: [2024-09-29 Sun 00:21]
- _Rust custom data types_ are formed mainly through the two keywords:
  * ~struct~: define a structure
  * ~enum~: define an enumeration

- /Constants/ can also be created via the ~const~ and ~static~ keywords.

** DONE 3.1. Structures
CLOSED: [2024-09-29 Sun 00:08]
- There are *THREE types* of structures ("structs") that can be created using the
  ~struct~ keyword:
  * /Tuple structs/, which are, basically, /named tuples/.
  * The classic C structs
  * /Unit structs/, which are _field-less_, are useful for generics.

** DONE 3.3. constants
CLOSED: [2024-09-29 Sun 00:21]
Rust has _TWO different types of constants_ which *can be declared in any scope
including global.* Both REQUIRE *explicit type annotation*:
- ~const~: An _unchangeable_ value (the common case).

- ~static~: A *possibly mutable variable* with ~'static~ /lifetime/.
  * The /static lifetime/ is inferred and does not have to be specified.
  * _Accessing or modifying a mutable static variable is *unsafe*._

* DONE 4. Variable Bindings

** DONE 4.1. Mutability
CLOSED: [2024-09-29 Sun 00:23]
** DONE 4.2. Scope and Shadowing
CLOSED: [2024-09-29 Sun 00:23]
** DONE 4.3. Declare first
CLOSED: [2024-09-29 Sun 00:26]
It's possible to
1. declare variable bindings first, and
2. initialize them later.

_HOWEVER_, this form is *SELDOM used*, as it may lead to the use of
/uninitialized variables/.

#+begin_src rust
  fn main() {
      // Declare a variable binding
      let a_binding;

      {
          let x = 2;

          // Initialize the binding
          a_binding = x * x;
      }

      println!("a binding: {}", a_binding);

      let another_binding;

      // Error! Use of uninitialized binding
      println!("another binding: {}", another_binding);
      // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

      another_binding = 1;

      println!("another binding: {}", another_binding);
  }
#+end_src
The compiler *FORBIDS* use of /uninitialized variables/, as this would LEAD TO
/undefined behavior/.

** DONE 4.4. Freezing
CLOSED: [2024-09-29 Sun 00:28]
When data _is bound by the SAME NAME IMMUTABLY_, it also *freezes*.
/Frozen data/ can't be modified until the /immutable binding/ _goes out of_
/scope/:
#+begin_src rust
  fn main() {
      let mut _mutable_integer = 7i32;

      {
          // Shadowing by immutable `_mutable_integer`
          let _mutable_integer = _mutable_integer;

          // Error! `_mutable_integer` is frozen in this scope
          _mutable_integer = 50;
          // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

          // `_mutable_integer` goes out of scope
      }

      // Ok! `_mutable_integer` is not frozen in this scope
      _mutable_integer = 3;
  }
#+end_src

* TODO 5. Types
Rust provides several mechanisms to *change* or *define* the /type/ of primitive
and user defined types. The following sections cover:

- *Casting* between /primitive types/
- *Specifying* the desired /type/ of /literals/
- Using /type inference/
- /Aliasing types/
