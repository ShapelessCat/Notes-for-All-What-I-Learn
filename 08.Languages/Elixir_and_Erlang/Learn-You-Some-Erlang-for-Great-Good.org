** So What’s Erlang? - 2
   - Erlang has a large _emphasis_ on /concurrency/ and /high reliability/.

   - To be able to have dozens of tasks being performed at the same time, Erlang
     uses the /actor model/, and _each /actor/ is a separate /process/ in the
     virtual machine._

   - In practice, Erlang forces you to write /actors/ (/processes/) that will share
     no information with other bits of code _unless_ they pass messages to each other.
     Every communication is _explicit_, _traceable_, and _safe_.

   - Erlang is NOT JUST a language but also a development environment as a whole.
     Here are just some components of the standard distribution:
     + Development tools (compiler, debugger, profiler, and test frameworks,
       optional type analyzer)

     + The Open Telecom Platform (OTP) framework

     + A web server

     + Advanced tracing tools

     + The Mnesia database (a key/value storage system able to replicate itself
       on many servers, which supports nested transactions and lets you store
       any kind of Erlang data)

   - The virtual machine and libraries also allow you to
     + update the code of a running system without interrupting any program

     + distribute your code with ease on many computers

     + manage errors and faults in a simple but powerful manner.

   - =TODO=
     We'll cover how to use most of these tools and achieve safety in this book.

   - A general policy in Erlang: Let it crash.

     Erlang has ability to recover from errors, organize code with actors, and
     scale with distribution and concurrency.

*** DONE Entering Shell Commands - 8
    CLOSED: [2018-05-13 Sun 22:23]
    - Erlang Shell command: ~erl~

*** DONE Exiting the Shell - 8
    CLOSED: [2018-05-13 Sun 22:23]
    - You can use ~help()~ to find out the exist command.

    - quit: ~q().~, which is a shorthand for ~init:stop().~

    - When you type ~erl~ and get into the Erlang shell, you can see some lines before the first prompt:
      #+BEGIN_SRC text
        Erlang/OTP 20 [erts-9.3] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

        Eshell V9.3  (abort with ^G)
      #+END_SRC

      + Q :: What does ^G (usually Ctrl-G) do?
      + A :: Actually, the Erlang shell is _NOT JUST_ a simple shell as with
             other languages. Instead, it is _a BUNDLE of shell instances_, each
             running different jobs.

      + Moreover, you can manage them like processes in an operating system.
        Type ~h~ after you get into the "User switch command" mode after
        typing Ctrl-G, and you see:
        #+BEGIN_SRC text
          c [nn]             - connect to job
          i [nn]             - interrupt job
          k [nn]             - kill job
          j                  - list all jobs
          s [shell]          - start local shell
          r [node [shell]]   - start remote shell
          q                  - quit erlang
          ? | h              - this message
        #+END_SRC
        For example,
        * - ~k 3~ will terminate that 3rd shell and all the code it was running at the time.

        * ~i 4~ will stop the code that is running without killing the shell.

        * Create new shell instances by typing in ~s~ , list them with ~j~ , and
          connect to them with ~c [nn]~, where ~nn~ is a number.

      + Ast some point, you might see an asterrisk (*) next to some shell jobs:
        #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
          % --> j
              1* {shell,start,[init]}
        #+END_SRC
        This ~*~ means that this is the LAST shell instance you were using.

    - If your shell ever freezes:
      Type CTRL-G<Enter>, and then ~i~, and then ~c~.

      This will
      1. get you to the shell manager
      2. interrupt the current shell job,
      3. then connect back to it.

    - Each expression should end with a period!!!!!!!

    - A sequence of expressions *MUST be terminated with a period followed by
      whitespace (a line break, a space, and so on)*; otherwise, it won't be
      executed. You can separate expressions with commas, but only the result of
      the last one will be shown (although the others are still executed).

** DONE Some Erlang Basics - 10
   CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 02:33]
   Erlang is considered to be a relatively small and simple language.

*** DONE Numbers - 10
    CLOSED: [2018-05-13 Sun 22:31]
    - Erlang's ~/~ is used as the general division -- even integer-to-integer
      division results can be floating numbers.

      ~div~ is used /integer division/.

      ~rem~ is used for calculating remainder for /integer division/.

    - Numbers of other than base 10 should be written in the ~Base#Value~ pattern.
      For example,
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        2#101010. % 42
        8#0677.   % 447
        16#AE.    % 147
      #+END_SRC

*** DONE Invariable Variables - 11
    CLOSED: [2018-05-13 Sun 22:49]
    - In Erlang, /variables/ *BEGIN with an uppercase letter* by definition.
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        One.                 % * 1: variable 'One' is unbound
        One = 1.             % 1
        Un = Uno = One = 1.  % 1
        Two = One + One.     % 2
        Two = 2.             % 2
        Two = Two + 1.       % ** exception error: no match of right hand side value 3
      #+END_SRC
      + (line 1)
        You cannot use a variable before declaring it!

      + (line 3)
        You can reassign a value to a variable _ONLY WHEN this variable has the
        SAME value_.

        Technically, /variables/ can also start with an _underscore_, but by
        convention, ~_~ is used to take values you don't care about.

      + (line 2)
        ~=~ is NOT only be used as /assignment/!

        (line 3)
        ~=~ can be used /as comparison/ (Actually, this is a /pattern matching/!):
        * if its two sides are equal, it will return this value;
        * if they are not equal, an _exception error_ will be raised.

        More example:
        #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
          47 = 45 + 2.  % 47
          47 = 45 + 3.  % ** exception error: no match of right hand side value 48
        #+END_SRC

    - Erlang *shell specific* functionalities:
      + ~f(Variable).~: Erase the variable names from the environment.
      + ~f().~: Erase all variable names from the environment.

*** DONE Atoms - 12
    CLOSED: [2018-05-13 Sun 23:42]
    - There is a reason why variables names can't begin with a _lowercase character_:
      /atoms/.

    - While starting with a lowercase letter is ONE WAY to write an /atom/, there
      are also OTHER WAYS. For example,
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        atom.                     % atom
        atom_rule.                % atom_rule
        atoms_rule@erlang.        % atoms_rule@erlang

        'Atoms can be cheated!'.  % 'Atoms can be cheated!'
        atom = 'atom'.            % atom
      #+END_SRC
      + An /atom/ should be enclosed in single quotes ~'~
        * if it does _NOT begin with_ a LOWERCASE letter

        * if it contains any characters _other than_
          - alphanumeric characters
          - an underscore ( ~_~ )
          - an at sign ( ~@~ )

      + Line 5 also shows that an /atom/ _with single quotes_ is *exactly the
        same as* a similar /atom/ _without them_.

    - What are interesting for /atom/:
      + It is a _constant_, every value has a _unique_ name without any confusion.

      + It is IMPOSSIBLE for such a constant to be _undefined_!

    - *DOn't Drink too much KOOL-AID*
      + Atoms are really nice and a great way to send messages or represent
        constants.

      + HOWEVER,
        there are *pitfalls* to using /atoms/ for too many things:

        + Each /atom/ _consumes memory (4 bytes per atom in a 32-bit system and 8
          bytes per atom in a 64-bit system)_.

        + An /atom/ is referred to in an /atom table/, which is *NOT garbage
          collected*.
            So /atoms/ will accumulate until the system tips over, either from
          memory usage or because 1,048,577 /atoms/ were declared . =TODO= =???= =WHY THIS NUMBER???=

      + Conclusion:
        *This means /atoms/ should NOT be generated dynamically.*

        * If your system needs to be reliable, and user input lets someone crash
          it at will by telling it to create /atoms/, you're in serious trouble .

        * /Atoms/ should be seen as tools for the developer because, honestly,
          that's what they are.

        To reiterate:
        You should feel perfectly safe using /atoms/ in your everyday code as long
        as you type them in yourself.
          It’s *only dynamic generation* of /atoms/ that is _RISKY_ .

    - NOTE:
      + Some /atoms/ are /reserved words/ and CANNOT be used except for what the
        language designers wanted them to be:
        * function names
        * operators
        * expressions, and so on.

      + These /reserved words/ are as follows:
        ~after~, ~and~, ~andalso~, ~band~, ~begin~, ~bnot~, ~bor~, ~bsl~, ~bsr~,
        ~bxor~, ~case~, ~catch~, ~cond~, ~div~, ~end~, ~fun~, ~if~, ~let~,
        ~not~, ~of~, ~or~, ~orelse~, ~query~, ~receive~, ~rem~, ~try~, ~when~,
        and ~xor~ .

*** DONE Boolean Algebra and Comparison Operators - 14
    CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 02:23]
    #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
      true and false.       % false
      false or true.        % true
      false xor false.      % true
      not false.            % true
      not (true and true).  % true
    #+END_SRC
    - ~and~ and ~or~ are *NOT* short-circuit.

    - If you want short-circuit, use ~andalso~ and ~orelse~.

    - equality or inequality checks ~=:=~, ~=/=~, ~==~, ~/=~:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        5 =:= 5.    % true
        1 =:= 0.    % false
        1 =/= 0.    % false
        5 =:= 5.0.  % false

        5 == 5.0.   % true
        5 /= 5.0.   % false
      #+END_SRC
      + ~==~ and ~/=~ are used for the check you don't care about the exact type!

        You'd better always start with ~=:=~ and ~=/=~, and only use ~==~ and
        ~/=~ when you are sure you don't need exact comparison.

    - Other comparison:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        1 < 2.   % true
        1 < 1.   % false
        1 >= 1.  % true
        1 =< 1.  % true
      #+END_SRC
      Pay attention to the last one: ~=<~. It is different from almost all the
      other popular languages.

    - Erlang doesn't always get mad at you for using the wrong types:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        5 + llama.  %% exception error: .....

        % BUT

        5 =:= true.  %% false
      #+END_SRC

    - Erlang actually has *NO* such things as Boolean values /true/ and /false/.
      The terms ~true~ and ~false~ are /atoms/! You shouldn't expect them
      anything.

    - *NOTE*
      The correct ordering of each element in a comparison is the following:

      =VERY IMPORTANT!!!=
      *number < atom < reference < fun < port < pid < tuple < list < bit string*.

      =TODO= =???= =WHY=
      Some of these types won't be familiar to you, but you will get to know
      them through this book. Just remember that this is why you can compare
      anything with anything.
        To quote Joe Armstrong, one of the creators of Erlang, “The actual order
      is not important -- but that a total ordering is well defined is
      important.” =TODO= =???= =WHY=

*** DONE Tuples - 16
    CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 02:22]
    - SYNTAX:
      ~{Element1, Element2, ..., ElementN}~

      + Example:
        #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
          X = 10, Y = 4.  %% 4
          Point = {X,Y}.  %% {10, 4}
        #+END_SRC

    - Unpack tuples with /pattern matching/:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        Point = {4,5}.  %% {4,5}
        {4,5} = Point.  %% {4,5}
        X.              %% 4
        {X,_} = Point.  %% {4,5}
      #+END_SRC

    - A way to use /tuple/: use it as Haskell ~newtype~.
      It has a name called /tagged tuple/.
      For example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        PreciseTemperature = {celsius, 23.213}.  %% {celsius, 23.213}
        {kelvin, T} = PreciseTemperature         %% ** exception error: ...
      #+END_SRC
      OR
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        {point, {X, Y}}.  %% {point, {4,5}}
      #+END_SRC

*** DONE Lists - 18
    CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 02:22]
    - Erlang /lists/ are *heterogeneous* with SYNTAX:
      ~[Element1, Element2, ..., ElementN]~

      For example,
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        [1, 2, 3, {numbers, [4, 5, 6]}, 5.34, atom].
        %% [1, 2, 3, {numbers, [4, 5, 6]}, 5.34, atom].
      #+END_SRC

    - In Erlang, /strings/ are /lists/:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        [97, 98, 99].           %% "abc"
        [97, 98, 99, 4, 5, 6].  %% [97, 98, 99, 4, 5, 6]
        [233].                  %% "é"
      #+END_SRC
      Many people dislike these behaviors: =IMPORTANT=
      Erlang will print lists of numbers as numbers only when at least one of
      them could not also represent a letter.

      =TODO= =!!!=
      However, don't despair, because there are other ways to write stings, as
      you'll see in "Binary Strings" on page 27.

    - *Don't Drink Too Much Kool-Aid* =TODO= =RE-WRITE NOTE!=
      This is why some programmers say that _Erlang SUCKS at STRING MANIPULATION_:
      + It does _not have a built-in string type_ as in most other languages.
        * Rationale:
          The lack is due to Erlang’s origins as a language created and used by
          telecom companies. They never (or rarely) used strings, so they were
          not officially added to the language as their own data type.

      + Improvement after years:
        However, this problem is getting fixed with time.
        The virtual machine (VM) now
        * *PARTIALLY* supports Unicode
        * is getting faster at string manipulations all the time.

      + There is also a way to *store* strings as a /binary data structure/,
        making them really light and faster to work with.
        =TODO= We'll discuss this in “Binary Strings” on page 27.

      All in all, some functions are *still missing from* the standard library
      when it comes to strings.

    - Concatenation ~++~ and elimination ~--~.
      For example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        [1, 2, 3] ++ [4, 5].           %% [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -- [1, 2, 3].  %% [4, 5]
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -- [1, 8].     %% [2, 3, 4, 5]
      #+END_SRC

    - Both of ~++~ and ~--~ are *right-associative*:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        [1, 2, 3] -- [1, 2] -- [3].  %% [3]
        [1, 2, 3] -- [1, 2] -- [2].  %% [2, 3]
      #+END_SRC

    - Two built-in functions (BIFs) for /lists/: head (~hd~) and tail (~tl~).
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        hd([1, 2, 3, 4]).  %% 1
        tl([1, 2, 3, 4]).  %% [2, 3, 4]
      #+END_SRC

    - NOTE:
      BIFs are usually functions that could not be implemented in pure Erlang,
      and as such are defined in C, or whichever language Erlang happens to be
      implemented in (it was Prolog in the 1980s).

      Sometime, "could not" does only mean "for the efficiency reason, could not".
      For example, the BIF ~length(List)~.

    - /Pattern matching/ the head and tail:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        List = [2, 3, 4].    %% [2,3,4]
        NewList = [1|List].  %% [1, 2,3,4]

        [Head|Tail] = NewList.     %% [1, 2, 3, 4]
        Head.                      %% 1
        Tail.                      %% [2, 3, 4]
        [NewHead|NewTail] = Tail.  %% [2, 3, 4]
        NewHead.                   %% 2
      #+END_SRC
      + The ~|~ is called the /cons/ operator.
        The /list/ can be built with only /cons/ operators and values:
        #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
          [1 | []].              % [1]
          [2 | [1 | []]].        % [2, 1]
          [3 | [2 | [1 | []]]].  % [3, 2, 1]
        #+END_SRC

    - NOTE:
      /Improper lists/, like ~[1 | 2]~, although syntactically valid, are of very
      limited use outside of user-defined data structures.

      You can apply the ~[Head|Tail]~ pattern matching on /improper lists/,
      but you *cannot* apply standard functions of Erlang (even ~length()~).

*** DONE List Comprehensions - 21
    CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 02:33]
    - For example:
      ~[2*N || N <- [1,2,3,4]].  %% [2, 4, 6, 8]~

    - The arrow ~<-~ acts exactly like the ~=~ operator,
      with the exception that it doesn't throw exceptions -- it just ignore the
      unmatched data. See below the example "Use List Comprehensions as Filter".

    - Even number from 1 to 10.

** DONE Working with Binary Data - 23
   CLOSED: [2018-05-15 Tue 21:05]
   - Unlike most other languages,
     Erlang provides useful abstractions when dealing with binary values with
     pattern matching, instead of requiring the old-fashioned /bit twiddling/
     with special operators.
       It makes dealing with raw binary data fun and easy (no, really), =TODO= =HOW= =???=
     which was necessary for the telecom applications it was created to help with.

   - /Bit manipulation/ has _a unique syntax and idioms_ that may look kind of
     weird at first

*** DONE Bit Syntax - 23
    CLOSED: [2018-05-15 Tue 20:38]
    - Erlang bit syntax:
      + encloses binary data between ~<<~ and ~>>~
      + splits it in readable /segments/; each segment is separated by a _comma_.

      A /segment/ is a sequence of bits of a binary (not necessarily on a byte
      boundary, although this is the default behavior =TODO= =???=).

    - Example:
      Store an orange pixel of true color (24 bits).
      + The hexadecimal notation has the format #RRGGBB
      + A tint of orange is ~#F09A29~

      Then, you write code like:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        Color = 16#09A29.      % 15768105
        Pixel = <<Color:24>>.  % <<240,154,41>>
      #+END_SRC
      This basically says, "Put the binary values of #F09A29 on 24 bits of space
      (red on 8 bits, green on 8 bits, and blue also on 8 bits) in the variable
      Pixel."

      That value can then be written to a file or a socket later.

      The ~<<240,154,41>>~ is another representation which is equivalent to
      ~16#09A29~.

    - Unpack:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        Pixels = <<213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>.
        %% <<213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>

        <<Pix1,Pix2,Pix3,Pix4>> = Pixels.
        %% ** exception error: no match of right hand side value <<213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>

        <<Pix1:24, Pix2:24, Pix3:24, Pix4:24>> = Pixels.
        %% <<213,45,132,64,76,32,76,0,0,234,32,15>>
      #+END_SRC
      + ~<<Pix1,Pix2,Pix3,Pix4>> = Pixels.~ doesn't work, because ~Pixels~ has 24
        segments, rather than 4.

      + ~<<Pix1:24, Pix2:24, Pix3:24, Pix4:24>> = Pixels.~ works, because you
        specify how to store 24 segements into four parts.

    - Unpack and get the first part:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        <<R:8, Rest/binary>> = Pixels.

        R.
        %% 213
      #+END_SRC
      + ~Rest/binary~ is a syntactic sugar.

    - Erlang allows more than one way to describe a /binary segment/:
      + ~Value~ 
      + ~Value:Size~ 
      + ~Value/TypeSpecifierList~ 
      + ~Value:Size/TypeSpecifierList~

    - /TypeSpecifierList/ represents one or more of the following, separated by a
      hyphen (~-~):
      + /Type/
        * default: ~integer~

        * ~integer~, ~float~, ~binary~, ~bytes~, ~bitstring~, ~bits~, ~utf8~,
          ~utf16~, and ~utf32~ .

      + Signedness
        * default: ~unsigned~

        * ~signed~ and ~unsigned~

      + Endianness
        * default: ~big~ -- the standard used in network protocol encodings

        * ~big~, ~little~, and ~native~.

        * /Endianness/ *only matters* when the type is ~integer~, ~utf16~,
          ~utf32~, or ~float~.

        * There is also the option to use ~native~, which will _choose a
          runtime_ if the CPU uses little-endianness or big-endianness
          natively.

      + Unit
        * This is written as ~unit:Integer~.

        * unit :: the *size* of each /segment/.

        * =TODO=
          The allowed range of /unit/ is 1 to 256.
          It is set by default to 1 bit for integer , float , and bitstring types, and to
          8 bits for binary . The utf8 , utf16 , and utf32 types do not require a unit to
          be defined. The multiplication of size by unit is equal to the number of
          bits the segment will take, and must be evenly divisible by 8. The unit
          size is usually used to ensure byte alignment.
          The default size of a data type can be changed by combining dif-
          ferent parts of a binary. As an example, <<25:4/unit:8>> will encode the
          number 25 as a 4-byte integer, or <<0,0,0,25>> in its graphical representa-
          tion. <<25:2/unit:16>> will give the same result, and so will <<25:1/unit:32>> .
          Erlang will generally accept <<25:Size/unit:Unit>> and multiply Size by
          Unit to figure out how much space it should take to represent the value.
          Again, the result of this should be divisible by 8.

    - Examples:
      #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
        <<X1/unsigned>> = <<-44>>.

    - *DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH KOOL-AID*
      - Erlang is traditionally just NOT that great at heavy number-crunching.
          It would likely be a bad idea to do stuff like converting videos or
        images with it.

      - Take note, however, that Erlang is usually mighty fast for applications
        that do not require number-crunching, such as
        + reacting to events
        + message-passing (with the help of atoms being extremely light), and so
          on.

        It can deal with events in matters of milliseconds, and as such, is a
        great candidate for soft real-time applications.

*** DONE Binary Strings - 27
    CLOSED: [2018-05-15 Tue 20:46]
    - /Binary strings/ are much more efficient in terms of space.
      + Normal /list/, which is used to save /strings/, are similar to /linked
        lists/.

      + /Binary strings/ are more like C arrays.

    - The downside of /binary strings/ compared to lists is a loss in simplicity
      when it comes to pattern matching and manipulation.

      =IMPORTANT=
      Consequently, people tend to use /binary strings/ when storing text that
      won't be manipulated too much or when space efficiency is a real issue.

    - *NOTE*
      + Don't use /binary strings/ or /strings/ to tag data.
        You should use /atoms/.
        *The comparisons of /atoms/ take constant time, while the comparisons of
        /strings/ take linear time.*

      + Conversely, do NOT use /atoms/ to replace /strings/ because they are

** DONE What Are Modules? - 31
   CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 22:08]
   - module :: a bunch of functions grouped together in a single file, under a single name.
               
   - *ALL* /functions/ in Erlang must be defined in /modules/.

   - You may not notice:
     The BIFs mentioned in Chapter 1, such as ~hd~ and ~tl~, actually belong to
     the ~erlang~ /mdoule/.

     Actually, ALL of the arithmetic, logic, and Boolean operators also are in the ~erlang~ /module/.

   - =From Jian=
     You can consider the ~erlang~ /module/ is similar to the ~java.lang~ module
     in Java:
     The /functions/ in ~erlang~ are imported automatically, and for the other
     functions, you need to call them with the form
     ~Module::Function(Arguments)~.

** DONE Creating Modules - 32
   CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 22:08]
   - You can declare *two* kinds of things in a /module/:
     + /functions/
     + /attributes/

   - Attributes :: metadata describing the /module/ itself,
                   such as its name, the functions that should be visible to the
                   outside world, the author of the code, and so on.

   - All /module attributes/ follow the form ~-Name(Attribute).~.
     ONLY one of them is necessary for your /module/ to be complilable:
     ~-moudle(Name).~
     + The ~Name~ above should be an /atom/.

     + The ~Name~ must be same as the file name.

   - Export:
     ~-export([Function1/Arith, Funciton2/Arith, ..., FunctionN/Arity]).~

     =From Jian=:
     Erlang  wants to take control of what to export.
       To do this, Erlang need to provide extra info: it cannot be the /types/
     -- Erlang is a dynamic language. /arity/ is this kind of info.

   - *NOTE*
     /Exported functions/ represent a /module/'s /interface/.

     It is important to define an /interface/ that reveals *only the bare minimum*
     of what is necessary to use the /module's functions/.
       This lets you fiddle with the internal details of your implementations
     without breaking code that might depend on your /module/.

   - The _SYNTAX_ of defining a /function/:
     ~Name(Args) -> Body.~

     + Here *Name* must be an /atom/

     + *Body* can be _one or more_ Erlang /expressions/ separated by *commas*.

     + The /function/ is ended with a *period*.

     As many functional programming languages, Erlang doesn't have ~return~.
     Its /functions/ just return their last logical expression value.

   - *NOTE*
     The CONVENTION in the Erlang community:
     + ~%%%~:
       for comments that are _general_ to a /module/ (what the /module/ is used
       for, licenses, and so on) and divisions of different sections of a module
       (public code, private code, helper functions, and so on).

     + ~%%~:
       All other comments that are alone on their own line and at the _same
       level of indentation as the surrounding code_.

     + ~%~:
       This is used at the end of a line where there is code.

   - Import:
     ~-import(Module, [Function1/Arity, ..., FunctionN/Arity]).~

   - In Erlang, /import/ is strongly discouraged.
     The only exception is the ~lists~ /module/, whose /functions/ are used with
     a higher frequency.

   - Another way, often used when developing code, is to compile from the shell:
     ~c(ModuleName)~

   - *NOTE*
     After compiling, you get a file with =.bean= extension: ~ModuleName.beam~

     =TODO= HISTORY!!!

       useless:hello().
       %% Hello, world!

       %% Hello, world!
       %% -1
     #+END_SRC
     + You see the ~useless:hello()~ returns an /atom/ ~ok~.

       Erlang functions and expressions must always return something, even if
       they would not need to in other languages.

        ~-compile([debug_info, export_all]).~

    - *Note*

        * ~hipe:c(Module,OptionsList).~
          OR
        * ~c(Module,[native]).~

      + The compilation result is still a =.beam= file, but it will no longer be
        portable across platform.

** DONE Defining Macros - 38
   CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 23:30]
   - /Erlang macros/ are similar to C's ~#define~ statements, and are _mainly used
     to *define* SHORT FUNCTIONS and CONSTANTS_.
     
   - SYNTAX:
     + Define:
       ~-define(MACRO, some_value).~

     + Example:
       ~-define(HOUR, 3600). % in seconds~

   - An example of defining "function" macro:
     ~-define(sub(X,Y), X-Y).~

   - Use /macro/:
     ~?MACRO~

   - There are also a few predefined macros, such as the following:
     + ~?MODULE~
       it is *replaced* by the /current module name/ as an /atom/

     + ~?FILE~
       it is *replaced* by the /filename/ as a /string/

     + ~?LINE~
       it returns the line number of wherever the macro is placed

   - You can also check whether particular macros are defined in your code
     and conditionally define other macros based on that result.

     To do this, use the /attributes/ ~-ifdef(MACRO).~, ~-else.~, and ~-endif.~
     + Example 1:
       #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
         -ifdef(DEBUGMODE).
         -define(DEBUG(S), io:format("dbg: "++S)).
         -else.
         -define(DEBUG(S), ok).
         -endif.
       #+END_SRC
  
       * Use it:
         ~?DEBUG("entering some function")~
         It will only output information if the /module/ is compiled with a
         ~DEBUGMODE~ /macro/ present. Otherwise, return ~ok~ and do nothing.

     + Example 2:
       As another example, you could also _define tests to exist only if some
       test macro is first defined_:
       #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
         -ifdef(TEST).
         my_test_function() ->
             run_some_tests().
         -endif.
       #+END_SRC

       Then, using the /compile flags/ mentioned previously, we can choose
       whether to define ~DEBUGMODE~ or ~TEST~ as
       ~c(Module, [{d,'TEST'},{d,'DEBUGMODE'}]).~.

    - *NOTE*
      ~vsn~ is an automatically generated unique value that differentiates each
      version of your code, EXCLUDING comments.

      It is used in code /hot-loading/ (upgrading an application while it runs,
      without stopping it) and by some tools related to release handling.

      You can also specify a ~vsn~ value yourself by adding
      ~-vsn(VersionNumber)~ to your module.

*** DONE Circular Dependencies - 41
    CLOSED: [2018-05-14 Mon 23:39]
    For maintenance reason:
    - /circular dependencies/ should be avoided.

    - _Too many dependencies module_ should be avoided.

   - Greet to different people with different messages:
     #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
       greet(male, Name) ->
           io:format("Hello, Mr. ~s!", [Name]);
       greet(female, Name) ->
           io:format("Hello, Mrs. ~s!", [Name]);
       greet(_, Name) ->
           io:format("Hello, ~s!", [Name]).
     #+END_SRC
     + _Each of these function declarations_ is called a /function clause/.
       They must be separated by ~;~ and together form a /function declaration/.
       A /function declaration/ counts as one larger statement that ends with ~.~.

   - *Formatting with* ~io:format~
     + ~~n~: newline character

     + ~~s~: a format for strings and binary strings

     + ~~p~: print an Erlang term in the same way terms are output for you by the
       Erlang shell (adding indentation and everything).

     For example,
     #+BEGIN_SRC erlang
       io:format("~s~n", [<<"Hello">>])
       io:format("~p~n", [<<"Hello">>])
       io:format("~~~n")
       io:format("~f~n", [4.0])
