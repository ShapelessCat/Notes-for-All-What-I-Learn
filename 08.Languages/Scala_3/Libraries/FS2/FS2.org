I/O (networking, files) computations in constant memory
Stateful transformations
Resource safety and effect evaluation
Built on _Cats Effect_ and powers _http4s_, _skunk_, and _doobie_

* Getting Started
** Install
- The latest version for _Cats Effect 3_ is *3.12.0*, which supports Cats Effect
  3 and is cross built for Scala 2.12, 2.13, and 3.2.

- The latest version for _Cats Effect 2_ is *2.5.10*, which supports Cats Effect
  2 and is similarly cross built for various Scala versions.

* FAQ
** Why does stream evaluation sometimes hang in the REPL?
** What does ~Stream.compile~ do? Is it actually compiling something? Optimizing the stream somehow?
** What is the difference between Stream and Pull?
** Why are implicit instances of ~Network~, ~Files~, etc. only available for ~IO~?
