* TODO Overview
** DONE Getting Started
   CLOSED: [2021-08-19 Thu 00:45]
   - Initialize a Cats Effect 3 project:
     * Add this dependency to =build.sbt=:
       #+begin_src scala
         libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect" % "3.2.2"
       #+end_src
       + When using _Scala.js_, replace ~%%~ with ~%%%~.

       + When using _Scala 2_, it is highly recommended:
         #+begin_src scala
           addCompilerPlugin("com.olegpy" %% "better-monadic-for" % "0.3.1")
         #+end_src

     * Use the Cats Effect 3 Giter8 template:
       #+begin_src shell
         sbt new typelevel/ce3.g8
       #+end_src

   - Create a new Cats Effect application:
     #+begin_src scala
       import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp}

       object HelloWorld extends IOApp.Simple {
         val run = IO.println("Hello, World!")
       }
     #+end_src
     - Use ~sbt run~ to run it.

     - Applications written in this style have _FULL ACCESS_ to
       * /timers/,
       * /multithreading/,
       * all of the bells and whistles that you would expect from a full application.

   - A very silly version of FizzBuzz which runs _FOUR_ concurrent _lightweight threads_,
     or /fibers/,
     * one of which *counts* up an ~Int~ value once per second,
     * while the others *poll* that value for changes and *print* in response:
     #+begin_src scala
       import cats.effect.{IO, IOApp}
       import scala.concurrent.duration._

       // obviously this isn't actually the problem definition, but it's kinda fun
       object StupidFizzBuzz extends IOApp.Simple {
         val run =
           for {
             ctr <- IO.ref(0)

             wait = IO.sleep(1.seconds)
             poll = wait *> ctr.get

             _ <- poll.flatMap(IO.println(_)).foreverM.start
             _ <- poll.map(_ % 3 == 0).ifM(IO.println("fizz"), IO.unit).foreverM.start
             _ <- poll.map(_ % 5 == 0).ifM(IO.println("buzz"), IO.unit).foreverM.start

             _ <- (wait *> ctr.update(_ + 1)).foreverM.void
           } yield ()
       }
     #+end_src
     =TODO= Can understand this soon!

*** DONE REPL
    CLOSED: [2021-08-18 Wed 20:03]
    #+begin_src scala
      // In Ammonite:

      import $ivy.`org.typelevel::cats-effect:3.2.2`

      import cats.effect.unsafe.implicits._
      import cats.effect.IO

      val program = IO.println("Hello, World!")
      // program.unsafeRunSync()
    #+end_src
    - ~unsafeRunSync()~ function is not meant to be used within a normal application,
      BUT it is very useful for REPL-based experimentation and sometimes useful
      for testing.

    - As the name suggest, the implementation of ~unsafeRunSync()~ is *unsafe in several ways.*
      =from Jian= =Learn more?!?!=

*** DONE Testing
    CLOSED: [2021-08-19 Thu 00:45]
    The easiest way to write /unit tests/ which use _Cats Effect_ is with _MUnit Cats Effect_.

    - To get started, add the dependency:
      #+begin_src scala
        libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "munit-cats-effect-3" % "1.0.3" % Test
      #+end_src

    - Example:
      #+begin_src scala
        import cats.effect.{IO,  SyncIO}
        import munit.CatsEffectSuite

        class ExampleSuite extends CatsEffectSuite {
          test("make sure IO computes the right result") {
            IO.pure(1).map(_ + 2) flatMap { result =>
              IO(assertEquals(result, 3))
            }
          }
        }
      #+end_src
      * =from Jian=
        + Q :: Why not use
          #+begin_src scala
            IO.pure(1).map(_ + 2) map { result =>
              assertEquals(result, 3)
            }
          #+end_src

        + A :: Put the ~assertEquals~ expression into ~IO~ to make sure we can properly
                handle a _effectful operation_.

**** DONE Other Testing Frameworks
     CLOSED: [2021-08-19 Thu 00:45]
     - The _Cats Effect Testing_ library provides seamless integration with most
       major test frameworks:
       * ScalaTest
       * Specs2
       * ÂµTest
       * MiniTest

     - Simply add a /dependency/ on the module which is appropriate to your test framework of choice.
       For example, _Specs2_:
       #+begin_src scala
         libraryDependencies += "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect-testing-specs2" % "1.1.1" % Test
       #+end_src

     - Once this is done, you can write specifications in the familiar _Specs2_
       style, except where each example may now return *in* ~IO~:
       #+begin_src scala
         import cats.effect.IO
         import cats.effect.testing.specs2.CatsEffect

         import org.specs2.mutable.Specification

         class ExampleSpec extends Specification with CatsEffect {
           "my example" should {
             "make sure IO computes the right result" in {
               IO.pure(1).map(_ + 2) flatMap { result =>
                 IO(result mustEqual 3)
               }
             }
           }
         }
       #+end_src

**** DONE ScalaCheck
     CLOSED: [2021-08-19 Thu 00:45]
     Special support is available for _ScalaCheck_ /properties/ in the form of the
     _ScalaCheck Effect_ project. This library makes it possible to write
     /properties/ using a special ~forAllF~ syntax which
     _evaluate *ENTIRELY within* ~IO~ *WITHOUT blocking* /threads/._

** TODO Concepts
   _Cats Effect_ introduces a large number of _concepts_ which, while very general
   and individually simple.

   - This also brings along with it a set of terminology
     for describing _concepts_ and _scenarios_
     which can be *significantly different from* that
     which is used in other _asynchronous frameworks_ (such as _Akka_ or _Vert.x_).

   - *This page is an attempt to describe the _Cats Effect runtime_ at a high level,*
     introducing the _concepts_ and _terminology_ which is often assumed in
     discussions about the various details.

   - As a general orientation, though, _Cats Effect_ should be considered as living
     in the same conceptual space as any other /asynchronous runtime/ on the JVM.
     Some other common examples of such /runtimes/:
     * Akka
       + Akka tends to be viewed as a more holistic framework, particularly
         encompassing things SUCH AS
         - akka-http and
         - akka-cluster.

       + The elements of Akka which correspond most directly to _Cats Effect_ are
         ~Actor~ and ~Future~ (which is actually part of the _Scala standard library_).

     * Netty
       + Netty's core runtime (~EventLoopGroup~ and the various ~Handlers~) is
         relatively basic and mostly just in service of its /NIO wrapper/, which
         - _Cats Effect_ does *NOT provide*,
         - BUT _Fs2_ does.

       + Conversely, /Cats Effect's runtime/ is considerably *more robust*.

     * Tokio

     * RxJava

     * Vert.x

   - Note that all of the above libraries have *significant differences and
     conceptual mismatches* with _Cats Effect_.

     * _Tokio_ and _Vert.x_ are probably the *closest counterparts*,
       + though both are more /framework/ oriented approach.
       + WHILE _Cats Effect_ prescriptively defines itself as a /library/ 
         which enables a broad /composable ecosystem/.

     * In many places, _Cats Effect_ defines features and functionality
       which simply *doesn't exist in* these ecosystems.

       + As an example,
         *neither* _Akka (via ~Future~)_, _Netty_, *nor* _Vert.x_ have any
         support for /asynchronous cancelation (also known as "interruption")/,
         MEANING that
         basic functionality such as
         _/timeouts/ and /concurrent error/ handling_ can result in /resource
         leaks/ in a running application.

       + Another example of functionality mismatch:
         the /fiber-aware work-stealing runtime/, which is
         - *present in* _Tokio_ and (to a lesser extent) _Akka_,
         - BUT *not in* _Netty_ or _Vert.x_.

       + As a final example:
         /asynchronous tracing/ is
         - *present* to a *limited degree* in _Vert.x_ and _Akka_,
         - but *absent* from all other frameworks,
         and *NEITHER* of these provide a version of this functionality which is
         performant enough *for production use (unlike _Cats Effect_)*.

   - _Despite the DIFFERENCES,_
     it is generally helpful to understand that _Cats Effect_ fundamentally
     solves many of the same problems as other /frameworks/ in this space:
     it is a _FOUNDATIONAL /runtime layer/_
     which *makes it easy to*
     *build and scale* complex /high-performance asynchronous and parallel
     software/ on the /JVM/ and on /JavaScript/.

*** DONE Fibers
    CLOSED: [2023-01-24 Tue 02:25]
    - Put another way:
      with /fibers/, there is *NO difference* between
      * a /callback/
        and
      * a ~return~

**** Cancelation
     - By default,
       /fibers/ are CANCELABLE _at *ALL* points during their execution._
       * This means that
         + _unneeded calculations_ can be promptly terminated
           and
         + their *resources* gracefully _RELEASED as early as possible_ within an application.

     - In practice, /fiber cancelation/ most often happens in response to one of
       _TWO situations_: *timeouts* and *concurrent errors*.

     - As an example of the former:
       #+begin_src scala
         import scala.concurrent.duration.*

         lazy val loop: IO[Unit] = IO.println("Hello, World") >> loop
         loop.timeout(5.seconds) // => IO[Unit]
       #+end_src
       * The above constructs an ~IO~ which starts a /fiber/ defined by ~loop~.
       * This /fiber/ prints "Hello, World!" infinitely to standard out.
       * Left to its own devices, the ~loop~ /fiber/ will run forever.
       * _HOWEVER_,
         the ~timeout~ function delays for 5 seconds, after which it calls
         ~cancel~ on the /fiber/, _interrupting its execution_ and _freeing any
         resources it currently holds (in this case, none)_.

     - From the above example, you can see /fiber/ ~cancel~ is very similar in
       concept to the ~Thread#interrupt~ method in the Java standard library.
       * DESPITE the similarity, there are some important _DIFFERENCES_ which make
         cancelation considerably *more robust, more reliable, and much safer*:
         1. Cooperative
            + ~Fiber~
              When one /fiber/ calls ~cancel~ on ANOTHER /fiber/,
              it is effectively a request to the target /fiber/.

              1. If the _target_ /fiber/ is *unable to cancel at that moment* for any
                 reason, the _canceling_ /fiber/ *asynchronously waits* for
                 cancelation to become possible.

              2. Once cancelation starts,
                 the _target_ /fiber/ will run all of its finalizers (usually used
                 to release resources such as file handles)
                 *BEFORE*
                 yielding control back to the canceler.

            + ~Thread#interrupt~
               always returns immediately,
               EVEN IF the _target_ ~Thread~ has *NOT* actually been interrupted.

         2. Can be *suppressed* _within scoped regions_
            + If a /fiber/ is performing a series of actions which *must be*
              _executed ATOMICALLY_, it can use the ~IO.uncancelable~ method to
              =???= _mask the cancelation signal within the scope,_ ensuring
              that cancelation is deferred until the /fiber/ has completed its
              critical section.
              - The most common scenario:
                compound resource acquisition,
                where a scarce resource _might *leak* IF the /fiber/ were to be
                canceled "in the middle"._

            + ~Thread#interrupt~
              cannot be suppressed.

         3. The *fiber model* OFFERS _much more control and tighter guarantees
            around cancelation,_
            it is *POSSIBLE* AND *SAFE* to dramatically _increase the
            granularity_ of cancelation within the _target_ /fiber/.

            In particular, every step of a /fiber/ contains a /cancelation check/.
            This is _SIMILAR TO_ what ~interrupt~ would do if the JVM checked the
            /interruption flag/ on every ~;~.
            + This is exactly how the ~loop~ /fiber/ in the example above is
              canceled DESPITE the fact that the /thread/ never blocks.

            + Anyone who has ever attempted to use ~Thread#interrupt~ on a
              while-loop understands (=TODO=) how important this distinction is:
              in Cats Effect, canceling this kind of /fiber/ is possible and
              indeed quite common.
