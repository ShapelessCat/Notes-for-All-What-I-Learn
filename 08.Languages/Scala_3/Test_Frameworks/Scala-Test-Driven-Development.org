  CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 04:37]
  - The topics we will explore in this chapter are:
    + Testing frameworks
    + ScalaTest
    + Problem statement
    + IDE
    + Implementation

** DONE Testing frameworks
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 04:34]
   - testing framework :: a framework used for the *automated testing* of software.

   - A /testing framework/ is primarily a collection of
     + /postulations/
     + /perceptions/
     + /observations/

     which support automated testing of application code.

   - /Testing frameworks/ includes functionalities for unit tests, as well as
     /integration, smoke, and acceptance testing/. =???= =TODO=

   - There are *TWO main frameworks* for testing application code written in Scala:
     + ScalaTest
     + Specs2.

   - The choice of one over the other will depend on your testing approach.

     For example,
     + ScalaTest uses the JUnit like testing structure,

       whereas the

     + Specs2 test by itself is  =???= =TODO= =???=
       NOT prosaic
       BUT cleaves more closely to an _immutability ideal_.

     *ScalaTest is arguably more popular as it makes a transition from JUnit
     easier.*

** DONE ScalaTest
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 04:37]
   - ScalaTest includes multiple styles.
     It is a comprehensive framework for both BDD and TDD.

   - ScalaTest also *integrates* VERY WELL WITH various third party frameworks
     such as =TODO= =???= =TODO=
     + JUnit
     + TestNG =???=
     + Ant
     + Maven
     + SBT
     + ScalaCheck
     + JMock =???=
     + EasyMock =???=
     + Mockito =???=
     + ScalaMock =???=
     + Selenium, =???= and so on. =???=

   - ScalaTest also integrates with IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ.

*** TODO A quick tutorial
**** DONE Adding ScalaTest to the project
     CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 04:27]
     - In practice,
       it is advisable to use the _SAME testing style throughout the project_, so
       there is uniformity in testing and code that can be reused or refactored
       later.

     - From the author:
       I sometimes use *two* DIFFERENT styles in my project:
       + one for unit testing
       + another for functional testing.

       This makes it easier to look at the test and know if it can be run in
       isolation, as is the case with most unit tests.

     - It is recommended to use
       + ~FlatSpec~ for /unit testing/, for example
         #+BEGIN_SRC scala
           class AddSuite extends FunSuite {
             test("3 plus 3 is 6") {
               assert((3 + 3) == 6)
             }
           }
         #+END_SRC
         and

       + ~FeatureSpec~ for /functional or acceptance testing/, for example
         #+BEGIN_SRC scala
           import org.scalatest._

           class Calculator {
             def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
           }

           class CalcSpec extends FeatureSpec with GivenWhenThen {
             info("As a calculator owner")
             info("I want to be able add two numbers")
             info("so I can get a correct result")

             feature("Addition") {
               scenario("User adds two numbers") {
                 Given("a calculator")
                 val calc = new Calculator

                 When("two numbers are added")
                 val result = calc.add(3, 3)

                 Then("we get correct result")
                 assert(result == 6)
               }
             }
           }
         #+END_SRC

**** TODO Choose your testing style

** DONE Problem statements
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 01:08]
   Use /Gherkin language/, which is a DSL for describing BDD WITHOUT
   implementation details.

   - Example:
     *Feature: decimal to binary conversion*:
     As a user, I want to convert a decimal number to a binary number:
     + _Scenario 1_:
       * *Given* I have a number A
       * *When* I convert this number to a binary number
       * *Then*, I get a binary equivalent B of the original decimal number

     + _Scenario 2_:
       * *Given* I have binary number X
       * *When* I convert this number to a decimal number
       * *Then*, I get a decimal equivalent Y of the original binary number

     + _Scenario 3_:
       * *Given* I have decimal number A
       * *When*
         I convert A to binary to get binary number B,
         and again convert B to decimal number C
       * *Then* A is equal to C

   - This book use IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin.

** DONE Project structure
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 03:03]
   Create a Scala project with SBT in IntelliJ IDEA.
   =from Jian= Here ~./~ represents the _project root_.

** DONE Write a failing test – RED
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 03:01]
   - In =test=
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       package com.packt

       import org.scalatest.FlatSpec

       class DecimalBinarySpec extends FlatSpec{
         "base conversion utility" should "convert a number 99 into a
         binary number 1100011" in {
           var binary: Binary = BaseConversion.decimalToBinary(Decimal("99"))
           assert(binary.number == "1100011")
         }
       }
     #+END_SRC

   - In =main=
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       package com.packt

       object BaseConversion {
         def decimalToBinary(x: Decimal) = ???
       }
     #+END_SRC

     + Also add /package object/:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         package com

         package object packt {
           trait Number {
             def number: String
           }
           case class Decimal(number: String) extends Number
           case class Binary(number: String) extends Number
         }
       #+END_SRC

   - *Note*
     The definition of ~???~ in ~Predef~:
     ~def ???: Nothing = throw new NotImplementedError~

** DONE Writing application code to fix the test – GREEN
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 03:20]
   - *NOTE*

   - *TIP*
     Add a body ~Binary("1100011")~ to the definition of ~decimalToBinary~. this
     is used for us to learn what will happen when we can pass the test we
     wrote, THOUGH this is NOT the right implementation.

     When pass, we see GREEN output.

   - Add two lines to the ~DecimalBinarySpec~, then we have
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       package com.packt

       import org.scalatest.FlatSpec

       class DecimalBinarySpec extends FlatSpec{
         "base conversion utility" should "convert a number 99
         into a binary number 1100011" in {
           val binary:Binary = BaseConversion.decimalToBinary(Decimal("99"))
           assert(binary.number == "1100011")
         }

         it should "convert a number 245 into a binary number 11110101" in pending

         it should "convert a number 3141 into a binary number 110001000101" in pending
       }
     #+END_SRC
     + ~it~ is a shorthand to repeat the initial string ~"binary conversion utility"~.

     + ~pending~ means this test has _NOT_ been implemented!
       When you run tests you will see =Test Pending= output for each ~pending~ test.

** DONE More tests – REPEAT
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 04:24]
   - TDD testing cycle ::
        RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR -> REPEAT

   - For our till now simple examples, /refactor/ is NOT required.
     Just ignore it now, and MOVE TO _REPEAT_.

   - Let's fill in our pending tests:

     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       it should "convert a number 245 into a binary number 11110101" in {
         val binary: Binary = BaseConversion.decimalToBinary(Decimal("245"))
         assert(binary.number == "11110101")
       }

       it should "convert a number 3141 into a binary number 110001000101" in {
         val binary: Binary = BaseConversion.decimalToBinary(Decimal("3141"))
         assert(binary.number == "110001000101")
       }
     #+END_SRC

     + Now implement the body of ~decimalToBinary~ for general inputs:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         package com.packt

         object BaseConversion {
           def decimalToBinary(decimal: Decimal) =
             Binary(toBinary(BigInt(decimal.number)))

           @annotation.tailrec
           private def toBinary(num: BigInt, acc: List[BigInt] = Nil): String =
             num match {
               case 0 => acc.mkString
               case _ => toBinary(num / 2, (num % 2) :: acc)
             }
         }
       #+END_SRC

   - Also write ~BinaryToDecimalSpec~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       package com.packt

       import org.scalatest.FlatSpec

       class BinaryToDecimalSpec extends FlatSpec {
         "base conversion utility" should "convert binary number 100100111101 to decimal equivalent 2365" in {
           val decimal: Decimal = BaseConversion.binaryToDecimal(Binary("100100111101"))
           assert(decimal.number == "2365")
         }

         it should "convert binary number 11110001111110111 to decimal equivalent 123895" in {
           val decimal: Decimal = BaseConversion.binaryToDecimal(Binary("11110001111110111"))
           assert(decimal.number == "123895")
         }

         it should "convert binary number 100000000000001110000001 to decimal equivalent 8389505" in {
           val decimal: Decimal = BaseConversion.binaryToDecimal(Binary("100000000000001110000001"))
           assert(decimal.number == "8389505")
         }
       }
     #+END_SRC

   - Add ~BeanSpec~ to make sure that
     if the strings passed to ~Decimal~ and ~Binary~ are not all digits, /excpetions/
     should be thrown.

** DONE Intercepting exceptions
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 04:24]
   Two styles:
   - The JUnit style: Use ~try~ and ~catch~
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       try {
         Decimal("XYZ")
       } catch {
         case e: IllegalArgumentException =>
           assert(e.getMessage == "requirement failed: Unable to convert string to number")

         case _: Throwable => fail
       }
     #+END_SRC
     + The type annotation ~Throwable~ should always be there for the catch-all
       pattern in the ~catch~ block, or else a warning will should up -- ~_~
       should be a catch all but ONLY all ~Throwable~, NOT all else!!!

   - Use the ~intercept~
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       intercept[IllegalArgumentException] {
         Binary("XYZ")
       }
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Summary
   CLOSED: [2018-12-04 Tue 04:27]
   This chapter was intended to be _MORE hands on_.

   - Looked at ScalaTest and _HOW_ it fits in with other /unit testing/ frameworks
     for Scala.

   - looked at _different styles and specs_, which ScalaTest provides.

   - We also laid the foundation for the problem that we will be looking at
     *THROUGHOUT* the book.

     + We will be _adding more complexities_ to the same problem.

     + We will be looking to *create a robust test* harness by refactoring our
       tests at every stage.

* TODO 3. Clean Code Using ScalaTest
  Look at some examples of writing *clean* test code.

  - We will explore the following: =TODO=
    + Assertions
    + Matchers
    + Base test classes
    + Test fixtures

  - Some of the examples in this chapter comes from the ScalaTest official docs.

** DONE Assertions
   CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:26]
   - Three default /assertions/ that come out of the box with ScalaTest:
     + ~assert~
       =???= =from Jian= Any differences from the ~assert~ of Scala built-in?
       =TODO= =???=

     + ~assertResult~
       This is designed to differentiate between the _expected value_ and the
       _actual_:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         test("one plus one with result") {
           val two = 2
           assertResult(two) { 1 + 1 }
         }
       #+END_SRC

     + ~intercept~
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         intercept[IllegalArgumentException] {
           someMethod()
         }
       #+END_SRC

*** DONE Deliberately failing tests
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:06]
    Use ~fail()~ or ~fail("Failure message")~
    Thsi will throw ~TestFailException~ with the message, if any.

*** DONE Assumptions
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:11]
    Apart from the default assertions, the ~Assertion~ /trait/ also includes
    functionalities that can check preconditions to decide if the test should be
    canclled. *Cancel does NOT mean Fail!!*

    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      assume(database.isAvailable(), "Duh!!")
      assume(database.isAvailable())
    #+END_SRC

*** DONE Canceling tests
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:13]
    - ~cancel~ is similar to ~fail~, same number of overloaded variations.

    - ~cancel~ will throw ~TestCancelledException~.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        cancle()
        cancle("I cancelled it deliberately")
      #+END_SRC

*** DONE Failure messages and clues
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:26]
    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      assert("Hello".length == 5, "Message")

      assertResult(5, "Message") {"Hello".length}

      withClue("Message") {
        intercept[IllegalArgumentException] {
          someMethod()
        }
      }
    #+END_SRC

    - The ~intercept~ does NOT have an overload for a _message_.
      You have to use ~wihtClue~ to provide the _message_.

    - The ~withClue~ /method/ will
      *ONLY modify* the detailed message of an /exception/ that is _mixin the
      ~ModifiableMessage~ /trait/._

** TODO Matchers
   - Along with /assequality assertionsertions/,
     ScalaTest also supports a DSL for *expressing assertions in the test*.
     This is achieved using the word ~should~.

   - This is done by *mixing in* ~Matchers~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       import org.scalatest._

       class PacktSpec extends FlatSpec with Matchers
     #+END_SRC

   - The members of the /trait/ can be imported EXPLICITLY:
     ~import Matchers._~

   - You can mixin the ~Matcher~ /trait/ with your /test suite class/ to write
     /equality assertions/ like:
     ~message should equal ("Hello World")~

   - Alternatively,
     you can mixin ~MustMatcher~'s as an alternative to ~Matcher~'s,
     which proves same syntax and meaning as the ~Matcher~'s /trait/, but uses
     the verb ~must~ instead of ~should~.

*** DONE Matchers for equality
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:44]
    Five ways:
    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      message should be    ("Hello World")
      message shouldBe      "Hello World"
      message should equal ("Hello World")
      message should ===   ("Hello to World")
      message shouldEqual   "Hello World"
    #+END_SRC

    =from Jian= I don't like this kind of "flexibility"!!

*** DONE Matchers for instance and identity checks of objects
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:46]
    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      message shouldBe a [String]
      person should not be an [Animal]
    #+END_SRC

    - Any type parameters will be erased on JVM, therefore, it's recommended to
      use _underscore_ for type:
      ~names should be a [Seq[_]]~

    - References equality check:
      ~obj1 should be theSameInstanceAs obj2~

*** TODO Matchers for size and length
*** TODO Matching strings
*** TODO Matching greater and less than
*** TODO Matching Boolean properties
*** TODO Matching number within ranges
*** TODO Matching emptiness
*** DONE Writing your own BeMatchers
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:47]

** TODO Some more Matchers
   We have some more ~Matcher~'s that are _NOT as generic as_ the BASIC ~Matcher~'s
   from last section.

*** TODO Matchers for containers
*** DONE Combining Matchers with logical expressions
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:51]
    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      map should (contain key ("two") and not contain value (7))

      traversable should (contain (7) or (contain (8) and have size (9)))

      map should (not be (null) and contain key ("ouch"))
    #+END_SRC

*** DONE Matching options
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 00:54]
    You can work with /options/ using *ScalaTest's equality, empty, defined,
    and contain syntax.*

    - Example: 
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        optionVal shouldEqual None
        optionVal shouldBe    None
        optionVal should === (None)
        optionVal shouldBe    empty
      #+END_SRC

    - Example (specific values):
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        option shoudlEqual Some("hi")
        option shouldBe defined
      #+END_SRC

*** TODO Matching properties
*** DONE Checking that a snippet of code does not compileBase test classes
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 01:15]
    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      "val a: String = 1" shouldNot compile

      "val a: String = 1" shouldNot typeCheck

      "val a: Int = 1" should compile
    #+END_SRC

    They are implemented with /macros/, and the results are determined at
    /compile time/, but reported as tests failure at /runtime/.


** DONE Base test classes
   CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 01:32]
   - Try to create a base test class for your specific requirements like:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       package com.packt

       import org.scalatest._

       abstract class UnitSpec extends FlatSpec
                                  with Matchers
                                  with OptionValues
                                  with Inside
                                  with Inspectors
     #+END_SRC

     + This is actually what the author of this book want to use.

   - You usually create multiple this kind of base classes, each focused on a
     different kind of test.

     - For example, possbile senarios:
       You might have

*** TODO Feature – decimal to hexadecimal conversion
    - Similar to before we, add three scenarios:

        * *Given* a decimal number A
        * *When* I convert this number to a hexadecimal number
        * *Then*, I get a hexadecimal equivalent B of the original decimal number

      + _Scenario 2_:
        * *Given* a hexadecimal number X
        * *When* I convert this number to a decimal number
        * *Then*, I get decimal equivalent Y of the original hexadecimal number

      + _Scenario 3_:
        * *Given* a decimal number A
        * *When* I convert A to hexadecimal to get hexadecimal number B
          _And_ I again convert B to decimal number C
        * *Then*, A is equal to C

    + Clean code
    + Red-Green-Refactor
    + Code smell
    + To refactor or not to refactor?
    + Refactoring techniques
    + Building reusable test code

** DONE Clean code

** DONE Red-Green-Refactor
   CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 22:02]
   *Refactoring ALWAYS comes in after the Gree -- passing all tests.*

   - Most /refactoring/ is just common sense.
     However, NOT ALL!
     =TODO=

** TODO Code smell
   - Code smell :: a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper
                   problem in the system (by Martin Fowler).
   - For example,
     OVERSIZED /method/ and /testability/ are two /code smells/.

   - There are a few types of code smell that can be identified by looking at the code:
     =NEXT SUB-SECTIONS=

*** DONE Expendable - =re-read=
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 22:16]
    An *expendable* is something gratuitous and futile.
    Removal of such code will make the code cleaner, efficient, and comprehensible.

    It can be one of the follwoing:
    - *COMMENTS*
      + Code should be self-documented.
      + If you have too much coments, this usually means:
        * Just too much comments that used to describe details what you don't
          need to explain.
          OR/AND
        * The code is bad, and you need to write so much comments to clarify
          your code.

    - *CODE DUPLICATION*

    - *INSIGNIFICANT CLASSES*
      =TODO=
      This is a little hard to detect, but any class that is doing little or has
      a very insignificant task is a code smell. In most cases, this can just be
      given an inline class treatment, which we will discuss later.

    - *UNREACHABLE and DEAD CODE*
      This can be the residue of refactoring or just bad programming.
      Thanks to the Modern IDE's, which are good at detecting them.

    - *HYPOTHETICAL PLATITUDE*
      Don't write your code to support anticipated future changes that you don't
      have high confidence.

*** DONE Couplers
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 22:34]
    These /code smells/ contribute towards *excessive coupling* between /classes/.
    This makes the *classes untestable in isolation*.

    These smells are:

    - *Feature envy*:
      If your method is making extensive use of another class then it would mean
      that this method should belong in the other class it is envious of.

    - *Inappropriate intimacy*:
      When your class is using internal fields and methods of another class.
      This violates the rule of encapsulation.

    - *Function chaining*:
      When you see multiple functions chained together like ~a.b().c().d()~, then
      _it means that the client is responsible for *navigation along the class*
      structure_, resulting in smell.

    - *Broker class*:
      If the /class/ is designed to /delegate/ functionality to another class
      then _maybe_ this class is _not required_ at all.

*** DONE Modification thwarters =???=
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 22:36]
    - Deviating modification:
      When you find yourself changing many unrelated methods when changing a
      class. This is mostly a result of "copy-paste programming".
      =???=

    - Shotgun surgery:
      If to make one small change you have to make changes to many different
      classes, this means that the responsibility has been split up among a
      number of classes.

    - Parallel inheritance hierarchies:
      Whenever you create a subclass for a class, and you end up having to
      create a subclass of one or more other classes too.
      =???=

*** DONE Bloaters
    CLOSED: [2018-12-05 Wed 22:42]
    /Bloaters/ are /methods/ OR /classes/ that have increased to such monstrous
    proportions that they are very hard to work with:

    - *Long method*:
      The general RULE OF THUMB is that any /method/ _longer than 10 lines_ of
      code is a /code smell/.

    - *Large class*:
      This is a /class/ containing many /fields/ and /methods/.
      Ideally a /class/ should be around _200 at the most_.

    - *Primitive obsession*: TODO =SUMMARIZE=
      When your code uses primitive types rather than small objects, or
      constants, for information or as field names. Just as with many other
      smells, this arises because of moments of weakness, when you just need a
      field to store some data.

    - *Long parameter list*:
      When your method requires _MORE THAN Three or Four parameters_.
      This may mean several algorithms are merged in a single method.

    - *Data clumps*: =???=
      Sometimes different parts of code contain identical groups of variables,
      for example, when connecting to a database. These are candidates for
      moving into their own classes.

*** DONE Bug fixing
    CLOSED: [2018-12-06 Thu 16:11]

* TODO 5. Another Level of Testing
  - Test the interaction of your system with other systems outside the ecosystem.

  - We will be covering the following topics:
    + Integration testing

    + Behavior-driven development (BDD)

** DONE Integration testing
   CLOSED: [2018-12-08 Sat 12:43]
   - Integration testing sit, as a phase, *in between* /unit testing/ and
     /acceptance testing/.

   - The _process_ of /integration testing/:
     1. *Identify the interfaces* between the units that are used for interaction.

     2. *Specify a collection of units* with interfaces that form a complete
        end-to-end integration.

     3. *Create integration test cases* along with the inputs and expected outputs.

     4. *Evaluate the test* to determine if the results are matched and record the
        results.

*** DONE Functional testing
    CLOSED: [2018-12-07 Fri 22:11]
    - =from Jian=
      According to the description, *functionality testing* is a BETTER name.

    - Steps involved in functional testing:
      1. Identify the functionality to be tested.
      2. Create test data.
      3. Ascertain the expected output.
      4. Execute the test case.
      5. Compare output with the expected outcome.
      6. Collate results.

*** DONE Acceptance testing
    CLOSED: [2018-12-08 Sat 12:41]
    - /Acceptance testing/ is more FOCUSED on the _end customer_.

    - During /acceptance testing/, each user requirement is tested using a test
      case that
      FOCUSES ON
      the objectiveness, implementation, error handling, and other details
      specific to user needs.

*** DONE Need for user acceptance testing
    CLOSED: [2018-12-08 Sat 12:43]
    - =TODO= NOTE

    - The following are the steps in user acceptance testing:
      1. Analyze business requirements.
      2. Create a UAT test plan.
      3. Identify test scenarios.
      4. Create UAT test cases.
      5. Prepare test data (production-like data).
      6. Run the test cases.
      7. Record the results.
