** Fast
   Tests are run in parallel by default

** Easy
   Minimal imports, effect-types as first-class citizens, no pseudo-english DSL

** Pragmatic
   Failed tests are reported at the very end, even across suites

** Extensible
   Suites are mere streams of data, letting you bring your own patterns

* Overview
** Installation
   The artifacts below are available for
   *Scala JVM*,
