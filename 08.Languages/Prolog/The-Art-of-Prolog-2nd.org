* TODO Series Foreword
  The logic programming approach to computing investigates the use of logic as a
  programming language and explores computational models based on /controlled
  deduction/.

* TODO Foreword
* TODO Preface
* TODO Preface to First Edition
* TODO Introduction
* TODO I Logic Programs
  - A logic program :: a set of /axioms/, or /rules/, /defining relations/
       between objects.

  - A computation (of a logic program) :: a deduction of consequences of the
       protram.

  - A program defines a set of consequences, which is its meaning.

** TODO Chapter 1  Basic Constructs
   _THREE_ basic statements: /facts/, /rules/, and /queries/.

   There is a _SINGLE_ data structure: the /logical term/.

*** DONE 1.1 /Facts/
    CLOSED: [2017-08-15 Tue 02:59]
    - /facts/ :: a means of stating that a relation holds between objects.

    - An example of /facts/: ~father(abraham, isaac).~

    - /predicate/ :: another name for a relation.

    - /atoms/ :: names of individuals.

    - _A CASE CONVENTION_:
      names of both /predicates/ and /atoms/ in facts begin with a lowercase
      letter.

    - A finite set of facts constitutes a /program/.
      This is the simplest form of logic program.

      A set of facts is also a description of a situation.

      This insight is the basis of database programming, to be discussed in the
      next chapter.

*** TODO 1.2 /Queries/
    - /queries/ :: a means of retrieving information from a logic program.

    - A /query/ asks whether a certain relation holds between objects.

    - /queries/ and /facts/ look the same, but they can be disinguished by the
      context.

    - /goal/ :: the entity without the period or question mark.

    - A fact ~P.~ states that the goal P is true.

    - A query ~P?~ asks whether the goal P is true.

    - A simple /query/ consists of a single goal.

    - =TODO=
    - =TODO=
    - =TODO=

*** TODO 1.3 The Logical Variable, Substitutions, and Instances
    - /a logical variable/ :: an unspecified individual.

    - A logical variable is used _accordingly_:
      + Find out who is =abraham='s father. You kand keep asking
        ~father(abraham, milcah)?~, ..., ~father(abraham, isaac)?~ until an
        answer true/yes is given.

        However, with variables a better way to express the query is
        ~father(abraham, X)?~

        Used in this way
        /variables/ are _a means of summarizing many queries_.

    - =IMPORTANT= Variables in logic programs behave differently from variables
      in conventional programming languages.
        They stand for an unspecified but single entity rather than for a store
      location in memory.

    - Having introduced variables, we can define a /term/ -- the single data
      structure in logic programs.

      The definition is inductive.

      /Constants/ and /variables/ are /terms/.

    - /compound terms (structures)/ are /terms/.

    - /A compound term/ comprises a /functor/ (called _the principle functor of
      the term_) and a sequence of one or more arguments.

    - /A functor/ is characterized by its name, which is an /atom/, and its
      /arity/.

    - /ground/ :: NO variable /queries/, /goals/, and /more generally terms/.

    - /nonground/ :: with variables /queries/, /goals/, and /more generally
                     terms/.

    - /substitution/ :: =TODO= =TODO=

    - /instance/ :: /A/ is an instance of /B/ if there is a substitution \theta{} such
                    that A = B\theta{}.

      For example,
      1. the goal ~father(abraham, isaac)~ is an instance of ~father(abraham, X)~
         by this definition.

      2. ~mother(sarah, isaac)~ is an instance of ~mother(X, Y)~ under the subs-
         titution ~{X=sarah, Y=isaac}~.

*** TODO 1.4 Existential Queries
    - Logically speaking, variables in queries are /existentially quantified/,
      which means,
      + intuitively, that the query ~father(abraham, X)?~ reads: "Does there
        exist an X such that ~abraham~ is the father of ~X~?"

      + more generally, a query ~p(T_1 , T_2 , ..., T_n)?~, which contains the
        variables ~X_1~, ~X_2~, ..., ~X_k~ reads:
        "Are there ~X_1~, ~X_2~, ..., ~X_k~ such that ~p(T_1, T_2, ..., T_n)?~"

    - For convenience, /existential quantification/ is usually omitted.

    - /generalization/ :: A deduction rule
