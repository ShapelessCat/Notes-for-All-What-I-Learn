    - Run:
      use =java= to run the jar file generated by =kotlinc= (with its package
      flag(s)).

    - Kotlin is compatiable with all those common Java build systems such as
      /Mavan/, /Gradle/, or /Ant/.

    =IMPORTANT= =From Jian= =TODO=
    It seems there is a *BUG* if you use ~kotlinc~ as a REPL (Jian's Ver
    1.2.40):
      you cannot use the ~:quit~ command as the first command after getting into
    the REPL. ~:quit~ only works since the second prompt shows up!

*** DONE 1.5.6 Java-to-Kotlin converter - 15
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 14:38]
    - It is extremely easy if you use IntelliJ IDEA:
      + paste Java code fragment into a Kotlin file can trigger the conversion
        action;

      + invokde the "Convert Java File to Kotlin File" action to convert an
        entire file.

** DONE 1.6 Summary - 15
   CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 13:46]
   - Kotlin is /statically typed/ and supports /type inference/, allowing it to
     maintain, while keeping the source code _concise_,
     + _correctness_
     + _performance_ 
     
   - Kotlin supports both /object-oriented/ and /functional programming/ styles,
     + *enabling* _higher-level abstractions_ through /first-class functions/

     + *simplifying* _testing_ and _multithreaded development_ through the support
       of /immutable values/.

   - It works well for server-side applications, fully supporting all existing
     Java frameworks and providing new tools for common tasks such as
     /HTML generation/ =TODO= =???= and /persistence/.

   - It works for Android as well, thanks to a _COMPACT /runtime/,_ special compiler
     support for Android API's, and a rich library providing Kotlin-friendly
     functions for common Android development tasks. =TODO= =???=

   - It's free and open source, with full support for the major IDE s and /build
     systems/.

   - Kotlin is _pragmatic_, _safe_, _concise_, and _interoperable_, meaning it
     focuses on
     + using proven solutions for common tasks,
     + preventing common errors such as ~NullPointerException~'s,
     + supporting compact and easy-to-read code,
     + providing unrestricted integration with Java.

* DONE 2 Kotlin basics - 17
  CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 14:23]
  - This chapter covers
    + Declaring functions, variables, classes, enums, and properties
    + Control structures in Kotlin
    + Smart casts
    + Throwing and handling exceptions 

** DONE 2.1 Basic elements: functions and variables - 18
   CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 10:59]
*** DONE 2.1.1 Hello, world! - 18
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 10:44]
    #+BEGIN_SRC java
      fun main(args: Array<String>) {
          println("Hello, world!")
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - The function can be declared at the top level of a file.

    - The is no special syntax for /arrays/ as in Java like ~[]int~.
      The ~Array~ itself is just a normal type, with the most general syntax.

    - ~println~ is a wrapper of Java's ~System.out.println~, and you no longer
      need the prefixed package name in Java.

    - Semicolons can be omitted.

*** DONE 2.1.2 Functions - 18
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 10:47]
    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        fun max(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
            return if (a > b) a else b
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - *Statements and expressions*
      - In Kotlin, most /control structures/, _EXCEPT_ for the /loops/ (~for~,
        ~do~, and ~do/ while~) are /expressions/.

      - /assignments/:
        * Kotlin: statements

        * Java: expressions

**** EXPRESSION BODIES - 19
     - For single expression body, NO curly braces and the ~return~ are required.
       ~fun max(a: Int, b: Int): Int = if (a > b) a else b~

       This is called a /expression body/.
       The one with curly braces is called a /block body/.

     - =IMPORTANT=
       Omitting the /return type/ is allowed _ONLY_ for functions with an
       /expression body/ -- that's a conscious design choice, not a theory
       limitation!!!
       ~fun max(a: Int, b: Int) = if (a > b) a else b~

*** DONE 2.1.3 Variables Easier string formatting: string templates - 22
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 10:59]
    - If a variable doesn't have an /initializer/, you need to specify its type
      _EXPLICITLY_:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        val answer: Int
        answer = 42
      #+END_SRC
**** Mutable and Immutable Variables - 21
     ~val~ and ~var~

*** DONE 2.1.4 Easier string formatting: string templates - 22
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 11:03]
    - /string templates/
      For instance,
      + Simple expression: ~println("Hello, $name!")~
      + Complex expression: ~println("Hello, ${args[0]}!")~

** DONE 2.2 Classes and properties - 23
   CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 12:38]
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     /* Java */
     public class Person {
         private final String name;
         public Person(String name) {
             this.name = name;
         }
         public String getName() {
             return name;
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC
   has corresponding Kotlin code: ~class Person(val name: String)~, this is often
   called /value objects/ -- only data but no code inside body. The ~public~
   keyword disappears -- it is the default visibility in Kotlin.

*** DONE 2.2.1 Properties - 23
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 12:26]
    - In Kotlin, /properties/ are a *first-class language feature*, which entirely
      replaces /fields/ and /accessor methods/.

      You declare a /property/ in a /class/ _the same way you declare a variable_:
      with
      + ~val~: A ~val~ /property/ is *read-only*

      + ~var~: a ~var~ /property/ is *mutable*

    - The relation between Java's getter/setter and Kotlin's.
      =From Jian= I don't know if there is such a rule in Scala!?
      + ~getName~ <-> ~name~, and ~setName~ <-> ~name~ (= ...)

      + ~isMarried~ <-> ~married~, and ~setMarried~ <-> ~married~ (=...)

    - TIP
      You can also use the Kotlin property syntax for classes defined in Java.
      Getters in a Java class can be accessed as val properties from Kotlin, and
      get- ter/setter pairs can be accessed as var properties. For example, if a
      Java class defines methods called getName and setName , you can access it
      as a property called name . If it defines isMarried and setMarried
      methods, the name of the corresponding Kotlin property will be isMarried .
      =TODO=

*** DONE 2.2.2 Custom accessors - 25
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 12:26]
    #+BEGIN_SRC java
      class Rectangle(val height: Int, val width: Int) {
          val isSquare: Boolean
              get() {
                  return height == width
              }
          // OR, for short,
          // get() = height == width
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - Then you can use the ~isSquqre~ /property/, both in Kotlin and Java.

*** DONE 2.2.3 Kotlin source code layout: directories and packages - 26
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 12:37]
    - The /package/ of Kotlin is similar to that of Java.

    - As in Java (UNLIKE Scala), /import statements/ are placed at the *beginning*
      of the file and use the ~import~ keyword.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        package geometry.shapes

        import java.util.Random

        class Rectangle(val height: Int, val width: Int) {
          val isSquare: Boolean
              get() = height == width
        }


        fun createRandomRectangle(): Rectangle {
          val random = Random()
          return Rectangle(random.nextInt(), random.nextInt())
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - Use ~.*~ to import all in a particular /package/.
      For instance, ~import geometry.shapes.*~

    - In Kotlin, you can put _MULTIPLE_ /classes/ in the same file and choose ANY
      name (NO need to match the file name to a /class/ like in Java) for that
      file.

    - Kotlin doesn't impose layout restriction to packages.
      For instance, under the =geometry= folder, you have two files =example.kt=
      and =shapes.kt=, they can be the ~geometry.example~ /package/ and the
      ~geometry.shapes~ /package/, respectively, if you want.

      =Suggestion= Keep follow the Java convention, and you'll work well with Java
      without find ways to get rid of any meaningless troubles.

** DONE 2.3 Representing and handling choices: enums and ~when~ - 28
   CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 13:51]
   ~when~ as a replace of Java ~switch~, but more powerful.

*** DONE 2.3.1 Declaring ~enum~ classes - 28
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 12:46]
    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      enum class Color {
        RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, INDIGO, VIOLET
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - In Kotlin, ~enum~ is a so-called /soft keyword/: it has a special meaning
      when it comes before ~class~, but you can use it as a regular name in other
      places.

    - Just as in Java,
      ~enum~'s are *NOT* lists of values: you can declare /properties/ and /methods/
      on ~enum class~'es. Here's how it works.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        enum class Color(
            val r: Int, val g: Int, val b: Int
        ) {
          RED(255, 0, 0), ORANGE(255, 165, 0),
          YELLOW(255, 255, 0), GREEN(0, 255, 0), BLUE(0, 0, 255),
          INDIGO(75, 0, 130), VIOLET(238, 130, 238);  // The semicolon here is required.

          fun rgb() = (r * 256 + g) * 256 + b  // Define a method on the enum class
        }

        // >>>
        println(Color.BLUE.rgb())
        // 255
      #+END_SRC

      + =IMPORTANT=
        The example shows the ONLY place the semicolon is *MANDATORY*!!!
        It is use d separate the /enum constant list/ from the /method
        definition(s)/.

*** DONE 2.3.2 Using ~when~ to deal with enum classes - 29
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 12:51]
    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun getMnemonic(color: Color) =
          when (color) {
            Color.RED    -> "Richard"
            Color.ORANGE -> "Of"
            Color.YELLOW -> "York"
            Color.GREEN  -> "Gave"
            Color.BLUE   -> "Battle"
            Color.INDIGO -> "In"
            Color.VIOLET -> "Vain"
          }

        //  >>>
        println(getMnemonic(Color.BLUE))
        // Battle
      #+END_SRC
      + NO fallthrough, therefore no need for ~break~'s

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun getWarmth(color: Color) = when(color) {
          Color.RED, Color.ORANGE, Color.YELLOW  -> "warm"
          Color.GREEN                            -> "neutral"
          Color.BLUE, Color.INDIGO, Color.VIOLET -> "cold"
        }

        //  >>>
        println(getWarmth(Color.ORANGE))
        // warm
      #+END_SRC

      + Simplify the code
        #+BEGIN_SRC scala
          import ch02.colors,Color
          import ch02.colors,Color.*

          fun getWarmth(color: Color) = when(color) {
            RED, ORANGE, YELLOW  -> "warm"
            GREEN                -> "neutral"
            BLUE, INDIGO, VIOLET -> "cold"
          }
        #+END_SRC

*** DONE 2.3.3 Using ~when~ with arbitrary objects - 30
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 12:59]
    ~when~ allows any object, rahter than, like Java, only constants.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun mix(c1: Color, c2: Color) =
            when (setOf(c1, c2)) {
                setOf(RED, YELLOW)  -> ORANGE
                setOf(YELLOW, BLUE) -> GREEN
                setOf(BLUE, VIOLET) -> INDIGO
                else                -> throw Exception("Dirty color")
        }

        // >>>
        println(mix(BLUE, YELLOW))
        // GREEN
      #+END_SRC
      + ~setOf~ creates a ~Set~ with given elements.

*** DONE 2.3.4 Using ~when~ without an argument - 31
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 13:10]
    We want to avoid creating ~Set~ for every branch just for match, which can be
    costly, though mostly we don't care about it.

    =From Jian= Does Scala have this problem???

    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      fun mixOptimized(c1: Color, c2: Color) =
          when {
              (c1 == RED && c2 == YELLOW) ||
              (c1 == YELLOW && c2 == RED) ->
                  ORANGE

              (c1 == YELLOW && c2 == BLUE) ||
              (c1 == BLUE && c2 == YELLOW) ->
                  GREEN

              (c1 == BLUE && c2 == VIOLET) ||
              (c1 == VIOLET && c2 == BLUE) ->
                  INDIGO

              else -> throw Exception("Dirty color")
      }

      // >>>
      println(mixOptimized(BLUE, YELLOW))
      // GREEN
    #+END_SRC
    + NO argument ~when~ try to match a bool value ~true~.

*** DONE 2.3.5 Smart casts: combining type checks and casts - 31
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 13:20]
    - /interface/ implemetation doesn't have a keyword, use ~:~.

      =From Jian= This syntax design is good!

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        interface Expr
        class Num(val value: Int) : Expr
        class Sum(val left: Expr, val right: Expr) : Expr
      #+END_SRC

      + The Kotlin way use ~is~ to *check* (as ~instanceof~ in Java) and /cast/
        the type (the /cast/ step is done by the compiler if you use ~is~, this
        is called the /smart cast/).
        #+BEGIN_SRC scala
          fun eval(e: Expr): Int {
            if (e is Num) {
              return e.value

              //// if there is no smart cast:
              // val n = e as Num
              // return n.value
            }

            if (e is Sum) {
              return eval(e.left) + eval(e.right)
            }

            throw IllegalArgumentException("Unknown expression")
          }
        #+END_SRC

*** DONE 2.3.6 Refactoring: replacing ~if~ with ~when~ - 33
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 13:51]
    - Refactor with the ~if/else if/else~ expression
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun eval(e: Expr): Int =
          if (e is Num) {
            e.value
          } else if (e is Sum) {

        // >>>
        println(eval(Sum(Num(1), Num(2))))
        // 3
      #+END_SRC

    - As in Java, the curly braces are _optional_ if there's only ONE expression
      in an if branch.

    - Refactor with ~when~ -- less boilerplate code
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun eval(e: Expr): Int =
            when (e) {
                is Num -> e.value

*** DONE 2.3.7 Blocks as branches of ~if~ and ~when~ - 34
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 13:51]
    The branches of ~if~ and ~when~ can be /blocks/.
    Unlike Scala (if consider Kotlin's ~when~ as Scala's ~match~), curly braces
    is mandatory for ~when~'s branches if there is more than one statements!

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun evalWithLogging(e: Expr): Int =
          when (e) {
            is Num -> {

** DONE 2.4 Iterating over things: ~while~ and ~for~ loops - 35
   CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 14:09]
   - The ~while~ loop is _identical_ to the one in Java.

   - The ~for~ loop exists in ONLY ONE form, which is equivalent to Java's
     /for-each loop/.

*** DONE The ~while~ loop - 35
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 13:53]
    Kotlin has ~while~ and ~do/while~ loops.

*** DONE Iterating over numbers: ranges and progressions - 36
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 14:01]
    - Use ~..~ to generate /ranges/.
      For instance, ~val oneToTen = 1..10~
      *CAUTION* this ~..~ is like Scala's ~to~, rahte than ~until~.

    - progression :: iterate over ALL the values in a /range/.

    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 15:13]
    - The invocation like ~joinToString(collection, " ", " ", ".")~ will confuse
      people who read this code.

    - Java does NOT have /named arguments/, while Kotlin has!
      ~joinToString(collection, separator = " ", prefix = " ", postfix = ".")~
      + Specify the /unnamed arguments/ first followed by the /named arguments/.

      This is much better than the Java way:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        joinToString(collection, /* separator */ " ", /* prefix */ " ", /* postfix */ ".");
      #+END_SRC

    - *WARNING*
      _UNFORTUNATELY_, you *CANNOT* use /named arguments/ when calling /methods
      written in Java/, including /methods/ from the JDK and the Android framework.

      _Storing parameter names in =.class= files_ is supported as an *OPTIONAL
      feature* ONLY starting with Java 8, and

      *Kotlin maintains compatibility with Java 6.*

        As a result, the compiler can't recognize the parameter
      names used in your call and match them against the method definition.

*** DONE 3.2.2 Default parameter values - 48 =IMPORTANT=
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 15:13]
    =IMPORTANT=
    *Default values and Java* 
    Given that Java does *NOT* have the concept of /default parameter values/,
    you have to specify all the parameter values explicitly when you call a
    Kotlin function with default parameter values _from Java_.

    If you frequently need to call a function from Java and want to make it
    easier to use for Java callers, you can annotate it with ~@JvmOverloads~.
    This instructs the compiler to generate Java overloaded methods, omitting
    each of the parameters one by one, starting from the last one.

    For example, if you annotate ~joinToString~ with ~@JvmOverloads~, the
    following overloads are generated:
    #+BEGIN_SRC java
      /* Java */
      String joinToString(Collection<T> collection, String separator,
                          String prefix, String postfix);

      String joinToString(Collection<T> collection, String separator,
                          String prefix);

      String joinToString(Collection<T> collection, String separator);

      String joinToString(Collection<T> collection);
    #+END_SRC
    Each overload uses the default values for the parameters that have been omitted
    from the signature.

*** DONE 3.2.3 Getting rid of static utility classes: top-level functions and properties - 49
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 15:25]
    #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      // join.kt
      package strings

      fun joinToString(...): String { ... }
    #+END_SRC

    - Q :: How to use this in Java?

    - A :: The Kotlin's code above is equivalent to Java's code
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        package strings;

        public class JoinKt {
            public static String joinToString(...) { ... }
        }
      #+END_SRC

      You can use it in Java in this way:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        import strings.JoinKt;

        JoinKt.joinToString(list, ", ", "", "");
      #+END_SRC

    - *Changing the file class name*
      To *change the name* of the _generated class_ that contains Kotlin
      /top-level functions/, you add a ~@JvmName~ /annotation/ to the file.

      *Place it _at the beginning of the file_, _BEFORE_ the /package name/:*
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        @file:JvmName("StringFunctions")
        package strings

        fun joinToString(...): String { ... }
      #+END_SRC

      Now the function can be called as follows:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        import strings.StringFunctions;

        StringFunctions.joinToString(list, ", ", "", "");
      #+END_SRC

      A detailed discussion of the annotation syntax comes later, in chapter 10.

*** DONE Top-Level Properties - 51
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 15:32]
    /properties/ can also be top-level in Kotlin, though this feature is NOT

      var opCount = 0

      fun performOperation() {

      }

      fun reportOperationCount() {
        println("Operation performed $opCount times")
      }
    #+END_SRC

    - As normal /class-level properties/, the ~val~ /properties/ come with a
      /getter/, and the ~var~ /properties/ come with a /getter/ and /setter/.

    - If you want a constant like Java's ~public static final~ /field/, you should
      use the ~const~ modifier, *which
      is allowed for /properties of /primitive types/, as well as ~String~:*

   - The /extension function/ *cannot break* the /encapsulation/!!!!!!

     You *CANNOT* access the /private/ or /protected/ memmbers of the /class/ of
     a /extension funciton/.

   - On the /call site/, /extension functions/ are *indistinguishable* from
     /members/, and often _it doesn't matter_ whether the particular /method/ is
     a /member/ or an /extension/.

*** DONE 3.3.2 Calling extension functions from Java - 53
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 17:19]
    - Under the hood,
      an /extension function/ is a /static method/ that accepts the /receiver
      object/ as its *first argument*.

      Calling it doesn't involve
      + creating adapter objects
        or
      + any other runtime overhead.

    - Suppose you put your top-level functions in a file named =StringUtil.kt=:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        /* Java */
        char c = StringUtilKt.lastChar("Java");
      #+END_SRC

      Of course, you can ~import static StringUtilKt.*~ and use ~lastChar~ directly!

*** DONE 3.3.3 Utility functions as extensions No overriding for extension functions - 55
    CLOSED: [2018-05-26 Sat 17:26]
    - The final version of ~joinToString~, which is almost exactly what you'll
      find in the Kotlin standard library:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun <T> Collection<T>.joinToString(
                separator: String = ", ",
                prefix: String = "",
                postfix: String = ""
        ): String {
            val result = StringBuilder(prefix)

            for ((index, element) in this.withIndex()) {
              if (index > 0) result.append(separator)
              result.append(element)
            }

            result.append(postfix)
            return result.toString()
        }

        // >>>
        val list = listOf(1, 2, 3)

        // >>>
        println(list.joinToString(separator = "; ", prefix = "(", postfix = ")"))
        // (1; 2; 3)
      #+END_SRC

    - Because /extension functions/ are effectively /syntactic sugar/ over /static
      method calls/, you can use a *more specific type* as a /receiver type/,
      _NOT ONLY_ a /class/.
        Let’s say you want to have a join function that can be invoked only on
      _collections of strings_:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun Collection<String>.join(
            separator: String = ", ",
            prefix: String = "",
            postfix: String = ""
        ) = joinToString(separator, prefix, postfix)


        // >>>
        println(listOf("one", "two", "eight").join(" "))
        // one two eight
      #+END_SRC

    - We now what are underhood, then we know
      The _static nature_ of /extensions/ also means that /extension functions/
      *CANNOT be /overridden/ in /subclasses/.*

      If a /member function/ and a /extension function/ have the same signature,
      *ALWAYS the /member function/ wins*.

      =IMPORTANT=
      You should keep this in mind when extending the API of classes:
      if the API is changed, and a new /member function/ is added, which has the

      really be added to corresponding types objects, *there is NO proper place

     arbitrary number of arguments

   - An /infix notation/ that lets you call some one-argument functions without
     ceremony

   - /Destructuring declarations/ that allow you to unpack a single composite

    - A triple-quoted string can contain line breaks,
      + but you can't use special characters like =\n=.

      + On the other hand, you don't have to escape ~\~, so, for instance,
        the Windows-style path ~"C:\\Users\\yole\\kotlin-book"~ can be written
        as ~"""C:\Users\yole\ kotlin-book"""~.

    - You can combine /string templates/ and /triple-quote string/ together.
      However, since you CANNOT use escape in /triple-quote strings/, if you want
      to have a =$= character in your string, you do it in this way:
      ~val price = """${'$'}99.9"""~.

         Extracting a piece of code into an /extension function/ turns out to be

         Even though ~User~ is a part of your codebase and not a library class,

           it's not relevant to any other places where ~User~ is used.

         + If you follow this approach the API of the /class/ contains only the
           essential /methods/ used everywhere, so the /class/ remains small and

*** DONE 4.1.1 Interfaces in Kotlin - 68
    CLOSED: [2018-05-27 Sun 20:41]
    - We'll begin with a look at defining and implementing /interfaces/.

      /Kotlin interfaces/ are SIMILAR TO those of /Java 8/:
      they can contain
      + definitions of /abstract methods/

      + implementations of /non-abstract methods/ (similar to the Java 8
        /default methods/). Kotlin doesn't have and need the ~default~ keyword.

      + They *CANNOT* contain any /state/.

    - Example (Define and implement an /interface/)
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        interface Clickable {
          fun click()
        }

        class Button : Clickable {
          override fun click() = println("I was clicked")
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - Use the ~override~ modifier is _mandatory_ in Kotlin.

    - If a /class/ implement two /interfaces/ with same signature and name
      /methods/, neither one will win by default. *You must explicitly implement
      yours*.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        interface Clickable {
          fun click()

          fun showOff() = println("I'm clickable!")
        }

        interface Focusable {
          fun setFocus(b: Boolean) =
            println("I ${if (b) "got" else "lost"} focus.")

          fun showOff() = println("I'm focusable!")
        }

        class Button : Clickable, Focusable {
          override fun click() = println("I was clicked")

          override fun showOff() {
            super<Clickable>.showOff()
            super<Focusable>.showOff()
          }
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - *Implementing interfaces with method bodies in Java*
      *Kotlin 1.0 has been designed to target Java 6*,
      which DOESN'T support /default methods/ in /interfaces/.
        Therefore, it compiles each /interface/ with /default methods/ to a
      combination of a regular /interface/ and a /class/ containing the /method/
      bodies as /static methods/.

      + The /interface/ contains ONLY declarations

      + the /class/ contains all the implementations as static methods.

      =IMPORANT= =!!!= =IMPORTANT=
      Therefore, if you need to implement such an /interface/ in a Java class, you
      have to define your own implementations of all /methods/, including those
      that have method bodies in Kotlin.

*** DONE 4.1.2 ~open~, ~final~, and ~abstract~ modifiers: ~final~ by default - 70
    CLOSED: [2018-05-27 Sun 21:10]
    - Kotlin's /classs/ and /(concrete) methods/  are ~final~ _by default_.
      Add ~open~ for the /methods/ that open to be /overridden/.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        open class RichButton : Clickable {
          fun disable() {}

          open fun animate() {}

          override fun click() {}
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - The /overridability/ is _inherited by default_!
      Use ~final~ to change the /overridability/ of your /subclasses/ or /their
      methods/.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        open class Richbutton : Clickable {
          final override fun click() {}
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - *Open classes and smart casts* =TODO= =RE-READ= =???=
      One significant benefit of classes that are final by default is that they
      enable smart casts in a larger variety of scenarios.
        As we mentioned in section 2.3.5, smart casts work only for variables
      that couldn’t have changed after the type check. For a class, this means
      smart casts can only be used with a class property that is a val and that
      doesn’t have a custom accessor. This requirement means the property has to
      be final, because otherwise a subclass could override the property and
      define a cus- tom accessor, breaking the key requirement of smart casts.
      Because properties are final by default, you can use smart casts with most
      properties without thinking about it explicitly, which improves the
      expressiveness of your code.

    - In interfaces, you don't use ~final~ , ~open~ , or ~abstract~.

      =IMPORTANT=
      =From Jian= Even /concrete methods/ cannot be ~final~.
      If it is, you cannot override it to solve confliction comes from multiple
      /interfaces/.

    - /Abstract members/ are _ALWAYS_ ~open~, and they cannot be marked as ~final~.

*** DONE 4.1.3 Visibility modifiers: public by default - 73
    CLOSED: [2018-05-27 Sun 23:17]
    - The default visibility in Java, /package-private/, is _NOT present_ in Kotlin.

      Kotlin uses /packages/ ONLY as a way of organizing code in namespaces;
      _it does *NOT* use them for visibility control_.

    - As an alternative, Kotlin offers a _NEW_ /visibility modifier/, ~internal~,
      which means "visible inside a /module/."

      A /module/ is a set of Kotlin files compiled together.
      It may be
      + an IntelliJ IDEA module
      + an Eclipse project
      + a Maven or Gradle project
      + or a set of files compiled with an invocation of the Ant task.

    - The advantage of /internal visibility/ is that it provides real encapsulation
      for the implementation details of your /module/.
        With Java, the encapsulation can be easily broken, because external code
      can define /classes/ in the _SAME_ /packages/ used by your code and thus
      get access to your /package-private/ declarations.

    - ~private~ can be used in the top-level declarations.
      Then, the top-level declarations are only visible in the file where they
      are declared.

    - Table 4.2 - Kotlin visibility modifiers
      | Modifier         | Class member          | Top-level declaration |
      |------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------|
      | public (default) | Visible everywhere    | Visible everywhere    |
      | ~internal~       | Visible in a module   | Visible in a module   |
      | ~protected~      | Visible in subclasses | --                    |
      | ~private~        | Visible in a class    | Visible in a file     |

    - *Kotlin's visibility modifiers and Java* =TOOD= =RE-READ= =NOTE= =???=
      ~public~, ~protected~, and ~private~ modifiers in Kotlin are preserved when compil-
      ing to Java bytecode. You use such Kotlin declarations from Java code as if they were
      declared with the same visibility in Java. The only exception is a private class: it’s
      compiled to a package-private declaration under the hood (you can’t make a class
      private in Java).

      But, you may ask, what happens with the internal modifier? There’s no direct ana-
      logue in Java. Package-private visibility is a totally different thing: a module usually
      consists of several packages, and different modules may contain declarations from
      the same package. Thus an internal modifier becomes public in the bytecode.
      This correspondence between Kotlin declarations and their Java analogues (or their
      bytecode representation) explains why sometimes you can access something from
      Java code that you can’t access from Kotlin. For instance, you can access an inter-
      nal class or a top-level declaration from Java code in another module, or a
      protected member from Java code in the same package (similar to how you do that
      in Java).

      But note that the names of internal members of a class are mangled. Technically,
      internal members can be used from Java, but they look ugly in the Java code. That
      helps avoid unexpected clashes in overrides when you extend a class from another
      module, and it prevents you from accidentally using internal classes.

    - =See the Next Section=
      One more difference in visibility rules between Kotlin and Java is that an
      /outer class/ doesn’t see /private members/ of its /inner (or nested) classes/
      in Kotlin.

*** DONE 4.1.4 Inner and nested classes: nested by default - 75
    CLOSED: [2018-05-27 Sun 23:17]
    The _difference_ is that Kotlin /nested classes/ do _NOT have access_ to the
    /outer class/ instance, _unless you specifically request that_.

    - =TODO= =NOTE= =???=

    - Table 4.3 - Correspondence between nested and inner classes in Java and Kotlin
      | Class A declared within another class B                                           | In Java          | Ininner class Kotlin       |
      |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-----------------|
      | Nested class (doesn't store a reference to an outer class) static class A class A | ~static class~ A | ~class~ A       |
      | Inner class (stores a reference to an outer class) class A inner class A          | ~class~ A        | ~inner class~ A |

    - After using ~inner~, you can use ~this@OuterName~ to reference the /outer class/!

*** DONE 4.1.5 Sealed classes: defining restricted class hierarchies - 77
    CLOSED: [2018-05-27 Sun 23:02]
    You may remember when you use ~when~, you always need to write the ~else~
    branch to catch all else, and usually since nothing can be their, you can't
    get any meaningful value, you just _throw an exception_.

    - To avoid the ~else~ branch, use the ~sealed~ /classes/

      Note that the ~sealed~ modifier implies that the /class/ is /open/, and NO
      explicit ~open~ modifier required!

        }

        fun eval(e: Expr): Int =
          when (e) {
            is Expr.Num -> e.value
            is Expr.Sum -> eval(e.right) + eval(e.left)
          }
      #+END_SRC
      Combine ~sealed class~ with ~when~, an /exhaustiveness check/ will be applied!

    - There is *NO* /sealed interface/!

      Under the hood, the ~Expr~ /class/ has a /private constructor/, which can
      be called ONLY inside the /class/. You can't declare a /sealed interface/.

      =???= =TODO= =IMPORTANT=
      Why? If you could, the Kotlin compiler wouldn't be able to guarantee
      that someone couldn't implement this interface in the Java code.

    - *NOTE*
      In Kotlin 1.0, the /sealed/ functionality is rather *restricted*. For
      instance, all the /subclasses/ _must be nested_, and a /subclass/ *CANNOT*
      be made a ~data class~ (/data classes/ are covered later in this chapter).

      Kotlin 1.1 *relaxes* the restrictions and lets you define /subclasses/ of
      /sealed classes/ *anywhere* _in the same file_.

** DONE 4.2 Declaring a class with nontrivial constructors or properties - 78
   CLOSED: [2018-05-31 Thu 11:03]

     the /secondary constructor(s)/.

   - Kotlin also allows you to put additional initialization logic in /initializer blocks/.

*** DONE 4.2.1 Initializing classes: primary constructor and initializer blocks - 79
    CLOSED: [2018-05-31 Thu 09:52]
    - In chapter 2, you saw how to declare a simple class:
      ~class User(val nickname: String)~

      We can write it in the most explicit way:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        class User constructor(_nickname: String) {
          val nickname: String

          init {
            nickname = _nickname
          }
        }
      #+END_SRC
      + Here we see two new /keywords/: ~constructor~ and ~init~

      + Because the /primary constructor/ has a constrained syntax,
        it CANNOT contain the initialization code; that's why you have
        /initializer blocks/.

      + If you want to, you can declare _SEVERAL_ /initializer blocks/ in one
        /class/.

    - In this example, you _DON'T NEED_ to place the initialization code in the
      /initializer block/, because it can be combined with the declaration of
      the ~nickname~ /property/.

      You can also _OMIT_ the ~constructor~ /keyword/
      if there are _no annotations or visibility modifiers_ on the /primary
      constructor/. If you apply those changes, you get the following:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        class User(_nickname: String) {
          val nickname = _nickname
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - /Default values/ for /constructor parameters/ is also available!

    - To create an instance of a class, you call the constructor directly, _WITHOUT_
      the ~new~ keyword. This is UNLIKE Scala, which requires ~apply~
      /method(s)/ to do the same thing.

    - Kotlin use the similar way to initalize the /superclass/:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        open class User(val nickname: String) { ... }
        class TwitterUser(nickname: String) : User(nickname) { ... }
      #+END_SRC

    - As Java and Scala, if you _don't declare_ any /constructors/ for a /class/,
      a /default constructor/ that _does nothing_ will be *generated* for you.

    - You need to explicitly invoke the /superclass constructor(s)/. Even if it
      only have the /default constructor/, you need the empty parentheses!
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        open class Button
        class RadioButton: Button()
      #+END_SRC

    - The /private constructors/, which often works with /companion objects/.
      For instance, ~class Secretive private constructor() {}~

    - *Alternatives to private constructors*
      In Java, you can use a /private constructor/ that prohibits class
      instantiation to expression a container of static utility memebers or is a
      singleton.

      Don't do this in Kotlin!
      Kotlin has two functionalities to do these things, respectively!
      + /top-level functions/
      + ~object~

     - ~==~ *for equality*
       In Kotlin, the ~==~ operator is the default way to compare two objects:
       it compares their values by calling ~equals~ under the hood. Thus, if
       ~equals~ is /overridden/ in your /class/, you can safely compare its
       instances using ~==~.
         For /reference comparison/, you can use the ~===~ operator, which works
       exactly the same as ~==~ in Java by /comparing the object references/.

     - Example:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         class Client(val name: String, val postalCode: Int) {
           override fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean {

      Kotlin relies on /package-level functions/ and /object declarations.

   - A ~sealed~ /class/ can only have /subclasses/ nested in its declaration
     (Kotlin 1.1 will allow placing them *anywhere in the same file*).

   - /Initializer blocks/ and /secondary constructors/ provide flexibility for
     *initializing* /class instances/.

   - You use the ~field~ identifier to reference a /property backing field/ from
     the /accessor/ body.

   - /Data classes/ provide compiler-generated ~equals~, ~hashCode~, ~toString~,
     ~copy~, and other /methods/.

   - /Class delegation/ helps to avoid writing the simple method delegations
     explicitly.

      1. In Kotlin, a /syntactic convention/ lets you move a /lambda expression/
         *out* of parentheses _if it's the *last argument* in a function call_.
         ~people.maxBy() { p: Person -> p.age }~

      2. The empty parentheses can be omitted.
         ~people.maxBy { p: Person -> p.age }~

        the /named parameter/ version, some people prefer the _moved out_ version.

    - *INTELLIJ TIP*
      To convert one syntactic form to the other, you can use the actions:
      + "Move lambda expression out of parentheses"
      + "Move lambda expression into parentheses"

    - The type annotation of the parameter ~p~ in the /lambdas/ above can be
      omitted due to the type inference.

    - The default parameter name: ~it~ -- ~people.maxBy { it.age }~
      This name is generated
      + if the context expects a /lambda/ with _only one argument_,
        and
      + its type can be inferred.

    - However, if you store a /lambda/ in a variable, there's no context from
      which to infer the parameter types, so you have to specify them
      explicitly:

      + This function will always return 0.

      + Even though the ~onClick~ handler will modify the value of clicks, you

      + A correct implementation of the function would need to store the click
        count not in a local variable, but in a location that remains accessible
        outside of the function -- for example, in a property of a class.

    - Bound references: =TODO= =NOTE=
      + In Kotlin 1.0, when you take a _reference to a method or property_ of a
        /class/, you ALWAYS need to provide an /instance/ of that /class/ when
        you call the reference.

      + Kotlin 1.1 plan:
        Support for /bound member references/, which allow you to use the
        /member-reference syntax/ to *capture* a /reference to the method/ *on a
        specific object instance*, is planned for Kotlin 1.1:
        #+BEGIN_SRC scala
          val p = Person("Dimitry", 34)
          val personsAgeFunction = Person::age
          println(personsAgeFunction(p))
          // 34

          val dmitrysAgeFunction = p::age
          println(dmitrysAgeFunction())
          // 34
        #+END_SRC
        Note that ~personsAgeFunction~ is a _ONE-ARGUMENT function_ (it returns
        the ~age~ of a _given ~person~)_, whereas ~dmitrysAgeFunction~ is a
        _ZERO-ARGUMENT function_ (it returns the ~age~ of a _specific ~person~)_.

        Before Kotlin 1.1, you needed to write the lambda ~{ p.age }~ explicitly
        instead of using the /bound member reference/ ~p::age~.

    + /Kotlin collections/ and their _relationship_ to Java

  - Compared to Java, /Kotlin's type system/

  =TOOD=
  Let's look at the details.

** TODO 6.1 Nullability - 133
   - EN:
     conceal  -  隱匿

   - The common guiding thoughts for modern languages, including Kotlin, is to
     _convert_ these problems from /runtime errors/ into /compile-time/ errors.

     However, they have different ways to deal with ~null~.

   - =TODO=
     We'll cover the details of *mixing* Kotlin and Java code with respect to
     /nullable types/.

*** DONE 6.1.1 Nullable types - 134
    CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 10:39]
    - You can put a _question mark_ AFTER ANY /type/ to form /nullable types/.

    - For example, if you declare a function: ~fun strLen(s: String) = s.length~,
      you cannot pass a ~null~ to it, or else you will see a compiler error:
      =ERROR: Null can not be a value of a non-null type String=

    - If you think people may pass ~null~ as a parameter to a function ~strLen~,
      and you think this is reasonable in you practice, you define this function
      with a /nullable type/ parameter ~fun strLen(s: String?) = ...~

    - /Nullable types/ *force* you to do /null-check/.
      The compiler error of the definition ~fun strLenSafe(s: String?) = s.length()~
      is: 
      #+BEGIN_SRC text
        ERROR: only safe (?.) or non-null asserted (!!.) calls are allowed
         on a nullable receiver of type kotlin.String?
      #+END_SRC

    - You *CANNOT* assign it to a variable of a /non-null type/:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        val x: String? = null
        val y: String = x
        // ERROR: Type mismatch: inferred type is String? but String was expected
      #+END_SRC

    - You *CANNOT* pass a value of a /nullable type/ as an argument to a function
      having a /non-null parameter/:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        strLen(x)
        // ERROR: Type mismatch: inferred type is `String?` but `String` was expected
      #+END_SRC

    - The most important thing is to compare it with ~null~.
      The compiler can remember the result of comparisons.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun strLenSafe(s: String?): Int =
          if (s != null) strLen(s) else 0
      #+END_SRC

    - =TODO=
      You don't want to always use ~if/else~ and comparisons to check the
      /nullable type/, which is cumbersome. The are more convenient way to do
      this. Explain later!

    - *Other ways to cope with ~NullPointerException~ errors*
      In Java,
      + ~@Nullable~ and ~@NotNull~
        There are tools (for example, IntelliJ IDEA's built-in code inspections)
        that can use these /annotations/ to detect places where a
        ~NullPointerException~ can be thrown.

      + ~Optional~ introduced by Java 8.
        =From Jian= There are some bias from the author

        *NON-Biased Part*
        + =From Jian=
          Even if you have ~Optional~, you don't have /monad/, and the code can
          be verbose.

        + Even if you have ~Optional~ since Java 8, you still need to deal with
          ~null~ from other places -- this situation won't change utill Java
          deprecate ~null~ forever, and this definitely won't happen!

    - You know all type check happens in /compile time/, including the checks
      for /non-null types/ and /nullable types/. *NO* /runtime overhead/.

*** DONE 6.1.3 Safe call operator: ~?.~ - 137
    CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 11:07]
    - The /safe-call operator/ ~?.~ helps you to combine _a ~null~ check_ and a
      _method call_ into a SINGLE OPERATION.

    - For example,
      ~s?.toUpperCase()~ is equivalent to ~if (s != null) s.toUpperCase() else null~

      *CAUTION*
      The /return type/ of ~s.toUpperCase()~ is ~String~, and
      the /return type/ of ~s?.toUpperCase()~ is ~String?~.

    - /Safe calls/ can be used for _accessing properties_ as well, NOT JUST for
      _method calls_.
      For example,
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        class Employee(val name: String, val manager: Employee?)

        fun managerName(employee: Employee): String? = employee.manager?.name

        val ceo = Employee("Da Boss", null)
        val developer = Employee("Bob Smith", ceo)
        println(managerName(developer))
        // Da Boss
        println(managerName(ceo))
        // null
      #+END_SRC

    - Sequences of calls with ~null~ checks are a common sight in Java code, and
      you've now seen how Kotlin makes them more concise.

*** DONE 6.1.4 Elvis operator: ~?:~ - 139
    CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 11:20]
    The /elvis operator/ ~?:~ is used to provide a /default value/.

    - For example:
      ~fun foo(s: String?) { val t: String = s ?: "" }~

    - One reason that ~?:~ is particularly handy in Kotlin is that operations such
      as ~return~ and ~throw~ works as expressions and therefore can be used as the
      /default value/ part of ~?:~, which is very convenient to use ~?:~ for
      checking the preconditions.

    - ~with~ ?????????? =TODO=

*** DONE 6.1.5 Safe casts: ~as?~ - 140
    CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 11:37]
    ~as?~ combine /a castable check/ and a /cast/.
    If the the /castable check/ fails, a ~null~ is the result.

    - One common pattern of using a /safe cast/ is combining it with the /Elvis
      operator/.

      For example, this comes in handy for implementing the ~equals~ /method/.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String) {

          override fun equals(o: Any?): Boolean {
            val otherPerson = o as? Person ?: return false
            return otherPerson.firstName == firstName &&
              otherPerson.lastName == lastName
          }

          override fun hashCode(): Int =
            firstName.hashCode() * 37 + lastName.hashCode()
        }

        val p1 = Person("Dmitry", "Jemerov")
        val p2 = Person("Dmitry", "Jemerov")
        println(p1 == p2)       // true
        println(p1.equals(42))  // false

*** DONE 6.1.6 Not-null assertions: ~!!~ - 141 =???= =TODO= =RE-READ=
    CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 11:49]
    Use ~!!~ to convert a /nullable value/ to a /non-~null~ value/ or throw a
    ~NullPointerException~

    - You can do something like:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun ignoreNulls(s: String?) {
          val sNotNull: String = s!!
            println(sNotNull.length)
        }

        ignoreNulls(null)
        // Exception in thread "main" kotlin.KotlinNullPointerException
        //     at <...>.ignoreNulls(07_NotnullAssertions.kt:2)
      #+END_SRC
      + This is very interesting. Mostly you write something like this because
        you don't have a good solution for this problem.

      + But =TODO= =???=
        there are situations when /not-null assertions~ are the appropriate solution
        for a problem: when you check for ~null~ in one function and use the
        value in _another_ function, the compiler can't recognize that the use is safe.
        If you’re certain the check is always performed in another function, you
        may not want to duplicate it before using the value; then you can use a
        not- null assertion instead. =TODO= =???=

*** DONE 6.1.7 The ~let~ function - 143

        val email: String? = ...
        if (email != null) sendEmailTo(email)
      #+END_SRC

      Can be written as ~emil?.let { sendEmailTo(it) }~

    - When you need to check multiple values for ~null~ , you can use _NESTED_
      ~let~ calls to handle them.

      *BUT* in most cases, such code ends up fairly verbose and hard to follow.
      It's generally easier to use a regular ~if~ expression to check all the
      values together.

      + /Java primitive type/  ---->  /Kotlin types/ like ~Int~

        Simple!
        /Java primitive types/ become non-~null~ types (not platform types) in Kotlin

*** DONE 6.2.2 Nullable primitive types: ~Int?~, ~Boolean?~, and more - 154
    CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 12:25]
    - Kotlin /nullable types values/ will be compiled to the corresponding /Java
      wrapper types/.

    - As mentioned earlier, /generic classes/ are another case when /Java wrapper
      types/ come into play.

      If you use a /primitive type/ as a /type argument/ of a /class/, Kotlin
      uses the boxed representation of the /type/.

      For example, this creates a list of boxed ~Integer~ values, even though
      you've NEVER specified a /nullable type/ or used a ~null~ value:
      ~val listOfInts = listOf(1, 2, 3)~

    - As a consequence, if you need to _efficiently store large collections of
      primitive types_, you need to
      + either use a third-party library (such as Trove4J,
        http://trove.starlight-systems.com) that provides support for such
        collections
        =From Jian= HOW???
        or
      + store them in /arrays/.

*** DONE 6.2.3 Number conversions - 155
    CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 12:41]
    - Kotlin doesn't automatically convert numbers from one type to the other
      required compatible type. Since there is NOT /implicit conversions/ as in
      Scala, *all types conversions must explicit*!!!
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        val i = 1
        val l: Long = i  // Error: type mismatch
        val j: Long = i.toLong()
      #+END_SRC

    - /Conversion functions/ are defined for every /primitive type/ (except
      ~Boolean~).

    - *Primitive type literals*
      + For /primitive types/, use /suffix type indicator letters/!

      + For Hexadecimal literals, use the ~0x~ or ~0X~

      + For Binary literals, use the ~0b~ or ~0B~

      + You can insert underscores to numbers to improve the readability (Fron
        Kotlin 1.1 on!)

    - Pass /primitive types literal values/ to a function, and the compiler can
      help the function picking the most proper type even without the /suffix
      type indicator letters/:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        fun foo(l: Long) = println(l)

        val b: Byte = 1
        val l = b + 1L
        foo(42)
      #+END_SRC
      There is no explicit conversion, and they are legal code!

    - LIKE Java, Kotlin doesn't introduce any overhead for /overflow checks/!
      The programmer must pay attention to the overflow possibility in some
      calculation!!!

    - *Conversion from String*
      Also use the ~toNumberType~ pattern methods, such as ~toInt~, ~toByte~,

      Kotlin's ~Unit~.

    - Q :: What _distinguishes_ Kotlin's ~Unit~ from Java's ~void~, then?

    - A :: ~Unit~ is a full-fledged /type/, and, _UNLIKE_ ~void~, it can be used
           as a /type argument/.

           ONLY ONE value of ~Unit~ type exists;
           it’s also called ~Unit~ and is _returned implicitly_.

           =From Jian= When do we need to do such a nasty thing??? Override a
           generic function (mostly no side effect) with a function with
           side-effect only.

           This is useful when you override a function that returns a /generic
           parameter/ and make it return a value of the ~Unit~ type:

           For example,
           #+BEGIN_SRC scala
             interface Processor<T> {
               fun process(): T
             }

                 // do stuff

                 // You don’t need an explicit `return` here!
               }
             }
           #+END_SRC

    - In Java if you want do something like in the above example, you have _two_
      methods:
      + Use a separate interface (such as ~Callable~ and ~Runnable~).

      + Use the ~java.lang.Void~ type, and you must write down ~return null;~
        explicitly.

*** DONE 6.2.6 The ~Nothing~ type: "This function never returns" - 158
    CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 13:18]
    - For some functions in Kotlin, the concept of a /return value/ doesn't make
      sense because _they never complete successfully_.

      For example,
      + In many testing libraries, there is a ~fail~ function, it
        (=From Jian= ALWAYS???)fails the current test by throwing an exception
        with a special message.

      + A function that has an infinite loop which will never complete
        successfully.

    - The ~Nothing~ type does NOT have ANY values, so it only makes sense to
      + use it as a function /return type/

      + use it as a /type argument/ for a /type parameter/ that's used as a
        /generic function/ /return type/.

    - Functions returning ~Nothing~ can be used on the _right side_ of the /Elvis
      operator/ to perform /precondition checking/:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        val address = company.address ?: fail("No address")
        println(address.city)
      #+END_SRC

    - ~Nothing~ is very useful! =IMPORTANT=
      The compiler knows that a function with this /return type/ *never terminates
      normally* and uses that information when _analyzing_ the code calling the
      function.

      For example,
      In the previous example, the compiler infers that the type of ~address~ is
      non-~null~, because the branch handling the case when it's ~null~ always
      throws an exception.

   CLOSED: [2018-05-30 Wed 12:49]
   - Kotlin's support of /nullable types/ that detects possible ~NullPointerException~
     errors at /compile time/.

   - Kotlin provides tools such as /safe calls/ (~?.~), the /Elvis operator/ (~?:~),
     /not-null assertions/ (~!!~), and the ~let~ function for _dealing with_
     /nullable types/ concisely.

   - The ~as?~ operator provides an easy way to /cast/ a value to a /type/ and it
     also handle the case when it has a incompatible /type/.

   - Types coming from Java are interpreted as /platform types/ in Kotlin,
     allowing the developer to treat them as either /nullable/ or non-~null~.

   - Types representing basic numbers (such as Int ) look and function like
     regular classes but are usually compiled to Java primitive types.

   - Nullable primitive types (such as Int? ) correspond to boxed primitive types
     in Java (such as java.lang.Integer ).

   - The ~Any~ type is a /supertype/ of all other types and is analogous to Java's
     ~Object~.

     ~Unit~ is an analogue of Java's ~void~ .

   - The ~Nothing~ type is used as a /return type/ of functions that *don't
     terminate normally*.
     =TODO=

   - Kotlin uses the standard Java classes for /collections/ and
     enhances them with a _DISTINCTION_ between _read-only and mutable
     collections_.

   - You need to carefully consider /nullability/ and /mutability/ of parameters
     WHEN you *extend* /Java classes/ or *implement* /Java interfaces/ in Kotlin.
     =TODO=

   - Kotlin's ~Array~ class looks like a regular /generic class/,
     but it's compiled to a /Java array/.

   - _Arrays of primitive types_ are represented by special classes such as
     ~IntArray~.
