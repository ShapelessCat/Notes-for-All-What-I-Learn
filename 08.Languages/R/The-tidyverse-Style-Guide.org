  Two R packages support this style guide:
  - *styler*
    allows you to interactively restyle selected text, files, or entire
    projects. It includes an RStudio add-in, the easiest way to re-style
    existing code.

  - *lintr*
    performs automated checks to confirm that you conform to the style guide.

** DONE 1 Files
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 00:12]
*** 1.1 Names
    - Extension: .R

    - Stick with:
      + numbers
      + letters
      + -
      + _

    - If use prefixed number as a particular order,
      remember to pad 0's to make the number prefixes equal width.
      + Later realized missing steps should be in the pattern like ~02a~, ~02b~.

    - _Keep the file names lowercase._
      This can help us avoid the case-insensitive issue in some operating system
      like Windows or OS X.

*** 1.2 Organisation
    Give a file a concise name that still evokes its contents.
    No other detailed rules.

*** 1.3 Internal structure
    - Use commented lines of ~-~ and ~=~ to break up your file into easily
      readable chunks.
      #+begin_src python
        # Load data ---------------------------

        # Plot data ---------------------------
      #+end_src

    - If your script uses add-on packages, _load them *all at once at the very
      beginning* of the file._

      + This is more transparent than
        * _sprinkling_ ~library()~ calls throughout your code
          =from Jian=
          I'm not agree with this. It's better to import and use in local scope
          as narrow as we can.

          _OR_

        * having _hidden dependencies_ that are loaded in a startup file, such as
          =.Rprofile=. TODO ??? TODO

** DONE 2 Syntax
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:52]
*** DONE 2.1 Object names
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 00:25]
    - /Variable and function names/ should be in _snake case style_ and use *ONLY*
      + _lowercase_ letters
      + numbers
      + ~_~

    - Base R uses dots in _function names_ (~contrib.url()~) and _class names_
      (~data.frame~), but *it's better to _reserve dots exclusively for the S3
      object system_.*
      + In S3, /methods/ are given the name ~function.class~;
        if you also use ~.~ in _function and class names_, you end up with
        *confusing* methods like ~as.data.frame.data.frame()~.

    - If you find yourself attempting to _cram data into variable names_ (e.g.
      ~model_2018~, ~model_2019~, ~model_2020~), *consider using a /list/ _OR_
      /data frame/ instead.*

    - Generally,
      + _variable names_ should be *nouns*
      + _function names_ should be *verbs*.

    - Where possible, *avoid* _re-using names_ of common functions and variables.

*** DONE 2.2 Spacing
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:16]
**** DONE 2.2.1 Commas
     CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 00:59]
     Like _Regular English_, put a space after any comma, never before.

**** DONE 2.2.2 Parentheses
     CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:01]
     - For regular _function_:
       Do not put spaces inside or outside parentheses.

     - For ~if~, ~for~, or ~while~:
       Place a space *before* and *after* ~()~

     - Put a space after ~()~ of any function definition.

**** DONE 2.2.3 Infix operators
     CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:07]
     Surround by spaces.
     - A few exceptions:
       + The operators with high precedence ~::~, ~:::~, ~$~, ~@~, ~[~, ~[[~, ~^~,
         unary ~\minus~, unary ~+~, and ~:~:
         #+begin_src r
           sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
           df$z
           x <- 1:10
         #+end_src

       + /Single-sided formulas/ when the right-hand side is a single identifier:
         #+begin_src r
           ~foo

           tribble(
             ~col1, ~col2,
             "a",   "b"
           )
         #+end_src
         * single-sided formulas with a _COMPLEX right-hand side_ do *need* a space:
           #+begin_src r
             ~ .x + .y
           #+end_src

       + Tidy evaluation ~!!~ and ~!!!~
         #+begin_src r
           call(!!xyz)
         #+end_src

       + The _help_ operator
         #+begin_src r
           package?stats

           ?mean
         #+end_src

**** DONE 2.2.4 Extra spaces
     CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:16]
     Add spaces to do alignment of ~=~ or ~<-~
     #+begin_src r
       list(
         total = a + b + c
         mean  = (a + b + c) / n
       )
     #+end_src

*** DONE 2.3 Argument names
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:39]
    - A _function's arguments_ typically fall into TWO broad categories:
      + one supplies the data to compute on;
      + the other controls the details of computation.

    - When you call a function, you typically _omit the names of /data arguments/._
      =from Jian=
      * This often happens just because it's often clear which argument is /data
        arguments/ -- often the first one or two.

      * This rule should be broken when it is not clear that which are /data
        arguments/.

*** DONE 2.4 Code blocks
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:46]
    - K&R style ~{~ and ~}~ location.

    - 2 spaces indentation.

**** 2.4.1 Inline statements
     - Drop curly braces for very _simple_ statements that _fit on one line_,
       as long as they do _NOT have side-effects_.

     - Function calls that affect control flow (like ~return()~, ~stop()~ or
       ~continue~) _should ALWAYS go in *their own ~{}~ block*:_
       #+begin_src r
         if (y < 0) {
           stop("Y is negative")
         }

         find_abs <- function(x) {
           if (x > 0) {
             return(x)
           }
           x * -1
         }

         # from Jian: Of course, I never write the code llke the `find_abs`
         #            definition above. I write:
         find_abs_1 <- function(x) {
           if (x > 0) x else x * -1
         }
       #+end_src

*** DONE 2.5 Long lines
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:52]
    80 characters per line.
    - For too lone _function call_ (or _function definition_):
      #+begin_src r
        do_somethign_very_complicated(
          something = "that",
          requires = many,
          arguments = "some of which may be long"
        )
      #+end_src

    - Short unnamed arguments (mostly /data arguments/ which are usually used as
      the first some arguments) can also go on the same line as the function
      name, even if the whole function call spans multiple lines.
      #+begin_src r
        map(x, f,
            extra_argument_a = 10,
            extra_argument_b = c(1, 43, 390, 210209),
        )
      #+end_src

    - You may also place several arguments on the same line if _they are CLOSELY
      RELATED to each other_,
      #+begin_src r
        paste0(
          "Requirement: ", requires, "\n",
          "Result: ", result, "\n"
        )
      #+end_src

*** DONE 2.6 Assignment
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 00:27]
    #+begin_src r
      # Use <-, NOT =, for assignment.
      x <- 5
    #+end_src

*** DONE 2.7 Semicolons
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 00:46]
    Try not use.
    Especially, try not
    - put ~;~ at the end of a line,
    - use ~;~ to put multiple commands on one line.

*** DONE 2.8 Quotes
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 00:51]
    #+begin_src r
      # 1. Use ", not ', for quoting text.
      # 2. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.
    #+end_src
    - =from Jian= TODO TODO TODO
      Why not follow the convention of linux shell:
      + Constant string use ~'~
      + String with interpolation use ~"~

*** DONE 2.9 Comments
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 00:48]
    - Follow the general rules of writing comments in any programming language.

    - If you discover that you have _more comments than code_,
      considering SWITCHING TO *RMarkdown*.

** DONE 3 Functions
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 02:02]
*** DONE 3.1 Naming
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 02:02]
    As well as following the general advice for _object names_, strive to use
    *verbs* for _function names_.

*** DONE 3.2 Long lines
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 02:01]
    As in the last chapter.
    =from Jian= Even though this section does NOT mention 80 characters width.

*** DONE 3.3 ~return()~
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 01:57]
    Only use ~return()~ for *EARLY returns*.

    - ~return()~ should ALWAYS be on their own line
      because they have important effects on the control flow.
      See also _inline statements_. =from Jian= The are consistent.

    - TODO TODO TODO
      If your function is called PRIMARILY for its /side-effects/ (like printing,
      plotting, or saving to disk), *it should return the first argument
      invisibly*.
        This makes it possible to use the function as part of a pipe. ~print~
      methods should usually do this, like this example from httr:
      #+begin_src r
        print.url <- function(x, ...) {
          cat("Url: ", build_url(x), "\n", sep = "")
          invisible(x)
        }
      #+end_src
      TODO I don't know what is ~invisible~ here?????? TODO

*** DONE 3.4 Comments
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 02:00]
    In code, use comment to explain "why"
    NOT "what" or "how".

    - ~#~ follow a SINGLE space.

    - In stentence case.

    - Comments should be in sentence case, and only end with a full stop if they
      contain at least two sentences:
      #+begin_src r
        # Good

        # Objects like data frames are treated as leaves
        x <- map_if(x, is_bare_list, recurse)

        # Do not use `is.list()`. Objects like data frames must be treated
        # as leaves.
        x <- map_if(x, is_bare_list, recurse)
      #+end_src

   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 14:11]
   - The majority of advice in Chapter 1 also applies to files in packages.
   - Important differences are described below.

*** DONE 6.1 Names
    CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 14:11]
    - If a file contains a single function, give the file the same name as the
      function.

    - If a file contains multiple related functions, give it a concise, but
      evocative name.

    - _Deprecated functions_ should live in a file with =deprec-= prefix.

    - _Compatibility functions_ should live in a file with =compat-= prefix.

** DONE 7 Documentation - TODO - =Read-Later=
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 14:09]
*** 7.1 Introduction
    Use _roxygen2_ (TODO ???) with _markdown_ support enabled to keep your
    documentation close to the code.

*** 7.2 Title and description
*** 7.3 Indents and line breaks
*** 7.4 Documenting parameters
*** 7.5 Capitalization and full stops

** DONE 8 Tests - TODO
   CLOSED: [2020-02-23 Sun 02:06]
*** 8.1 Organisation
    - The organisation of test files should match the organisation of R/ files:
      if a function lives in =R/foofy.R=, then its tests should live in
      =tests/testthat/test-foofy.R=.

    - Use ~usethis::use_test()~ to automatically create a file with the correct
      name. TODO TODO TODO ??? TODO TODO TODO

    - The ~context()~ is NOT very important; a future version of testthat will
      display the file name instead of the context in output.
