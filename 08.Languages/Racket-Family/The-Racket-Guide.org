* DONE 1 Welcome to Racket
  CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 14:23]
  - Racket's main tools are
    + ~racket~:
      the /core compiler/, /interpreter/, and /run-time system/;

    + DrRacket:
      the programming environment

    + ~raco~:
      a command-line tool for executing *Ra*-cket *co*-mmands that
      * install packages,
      * build libraries,
      * and more.

** DONE 1.1 Interacting with Racket
   CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 02:59]
** DONE 1.2 Definitions and Interactions
   CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 03:05]
   - When using DrRacket, we usually
     1. Put definitions in the /definition area/;
     2. Use the definitions in the REPL.

   - When using command-line ~racket~ instead of DrRacket,
     you'd
     1. *SAVE* the defintions text in a file.
     2. If you save it as _"extract.rkt"_,
        then after starting ~racket~ in the _same directory_, you'd evaluate the
        following sequence:
        #+begin_src racket
          (enter! "extract.rkt")
          (extract "the gal out of the city")
        #+end_src
        + Here the ~enter!~ form both
          * *loads* the code and
          * *switches* the /evaluation context/ to the *inside* of the /module/,
            just like DrRacket's *Run* button.
     
** DONE 1.3 Creating Executables
   CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 14:23]
   - One way to run a Racket program: ~racket <src-filename>~

   - To package the program as an _executable_, you have a few options:
     + In DrRacket, you can select the *Racket|Create Executable...* menu item.

     + From a command-line prompt, run =raco exe ‹src-filename›=,
       where =‹src-filename›= contains the program. See "raco exe: Creating
       Stand-Alone Executables" for more information.

     + In *nix sytems,
       1. insert the line ~#! /user/bin/env racket~ at the very beginning of the
          file;
          * Rememver to put a space after ~#!~ 
       2. ~chmod +x <filename>~.
     
** DONE 1.4 A Note to Readers with Lisp/Scheme Experience
   CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 03:16]
   If you already know something about Scheme or Lisp, you might be tempted to
   put just
   #+begin_src racket
     (define (extract str)
       (substring str 4 7))
   #+end_src
   
   into _"extract.rktl"_ and run ~racket~ with
   
   #+begin_src racket
     (define (extract str)
       (substring str 4 7))
   #+end_src
   
   - Conclusion:
     It works, because ~racket~ is willing to *imitate* a traditional Lisp
     environment,
     + _BUT_ don't do that!!!!!!!!! The reasons:
       * Writing definitions *outside* of a /module/ leads to
         - bad error messages,
         - bad performance, and
         - awkward scripting to combine and run programs.

       * The problems are NOT specific to ~racket~;
         =from Jian= Try to learn more!!!!!!!!! =TODO=
         they're *fundamental limitations* of the TRADITIONAL *top-level
         environment*, which Scheme and Lisp implementations have historically
         fought with ad hoc command-line flags, compiler directives, and build
         tools.
         - The /module system/ is designed to *avoid* these problems, so start
           with ~#lang~, and you'll be happier with Racket in the long run.

     + =from Jian=
       You may notice the extension used above is _.rktl_.
       The _.rktl_ and _.rkts_ /file extensions/ are used for files meant to be
       *loaded at the top-level* that are *NOT modules.*
       + They
         * *don't necessarily* have a ~#lang ....~ line at the top,
         * *must be loaded* in some external environment with ~load~ INSTEAD OF
           imported with ~require~.

  This chapter provides a quick introduction to Racket as background for the
  rest of the guide. Readers with some Racket experience can safely skip to
  Built-In Datatypes.

** DONE 2.1 Simple Values
   CLOSED: [2020-10-04 Sun 23:34]
   - /Racket values/ include /numbers/, /booleans/, /strings/, and /byte strings/.

   - In DrRacket and documentation examples (when you read the documentation in
     color), _value expressions are shown in green._

   - /Numbers/ are written in the usual way, including /fractions/ and /imaginary
     numbers/:
     #+begin_src racket
       1
       1/2
       1+2i

       3.14
       6.02e+23
       9999999999999999999999
     #+end_src
     + =TODO= More about /Numbers/ later.

   - /Booleans/ are ~#t~ for /true/ and ~#f~ for /false/.
     In conditionals, however, _all /non-~#f~ values/ are treated as /true/._
     + =TODO= More about /Booleans/ later.

   - /Strings/ are written between doublequotes.
     Within a string, backslash is an /escaping character/;
     #+begin_src racket
       "Hello, world!"
       "Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel"
       "λx:(μα.α→α).xx"
     #+end_src

     + for example, a backslash followed by a doublequote includes a /literal
       doublequote/ in the string.

     + _EXCEPT_ for an *unescaped* doublequote or backslash,
       ANY Unicode character can appear in a /string constant/.

     + =TODO= More about /Strings (Unicode)/ later.

   - In REPL, the /string literal/ will be displayed in normalized form
     #+begin_src racket
       "Bugs \u0022Figaro\u0022 Bunny"
       ;; "Bugs \"Figaro\" Bunny"
     #+end_src

** DONE 2.2 Simple Definitions and Expressions
   CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:56]
   - A /program module/ is written as
     #+begin_src racket
       #lang <langname> <topform>*
     #+end_src
     + A ~<topform>~ is
       * either a ~<definition>~
       * or an ~<expr>~

     + The REPL also evaluates ~<topform>~'s.

   - In syntax specifications,
     + text with a _gray background_:
       such as ~#lang~, represents /literal text/.

     + _Whitespace_ must appear between such /literals/ and /nonterminals/ like
       ~<id>~, except that _whitespace_ is not required BEFORE or AFTER ~(~, ~)~,
       ~[~, or ~]~.

     + A comment:
       starts with ~;~ and _runs until the end of the line_, is treated the SAME AS
       _whitespace_.
       * The "Reading Comments" section in _The Racket Reference_ provides _MORE
         on DIFFERENT forms_ of /comments/.

   - Following the usual conventions,
     + ~*~ in a grammar:
       *ZERO or more repetitions* of the preceding element,

     + ~+~:
       *ONE or more repetitions* of the preceding element,

     + ~{}~ *groups* _a sequence_ AS AN element for repetition.

*** DONE 2.2.1 Definitions
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:20]
    - Bind ~<id>~ to the result of ~<expr>~:
      #+begin_src racket
        ( define <id> <expr> )
      #+end_src

    - Bind ~<id>~ to a /function/ (also called a /procedure/) that takes /arguments/
      as _named by_ the remaining ~<id>~'s.
      #+begin_src racket
        ( define ( <id> <id>* ) <expr>+ )
      #+end_src
      + When the /function/ is called, it returns the result of the *LAST* ~<expr>~.
        Mostly, all the other ~<expr>~'s are there for /side effect/.

    - "Definitions: define" (later in this guide) explains more about definitions.

*** DONE 2.2.2 An Aside on Indenting Code
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:23]
*** DONE 2.2.3 Identifiers
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:26]
    - Racket's syntax for /identifiers/ is especially LIBERAL.
      *Excluding* the special characters:
      + (
      + )

      + [
      + ]

      + {
      + }

      + "

      + `

      + ,
      + ;
      + #

      + \

    - "Identifiers and Binding" (later in this guide) explains more about identifiers.

*** DONE 2.2.4 Function Calls (Procedure Applications)
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:29]
    - /Function Calls/ \equiv{} /Procedure Applications/
      /Procedure Applications/ is a more traditional terminology.

    - Syntax:
      #+begin_src racket
        ( <id> <expr>* )
      #+end_src

    - "Function Calls" (later in this guide) explains more about function calls.

*** DONE 2.2.5 Conditionals with ~if~, ~and~, ~or~, and ~cond~
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:39]
    Syntax:
    #+begin_src racket
      ( if ‹expr› ‹expr› ‹expr› )

      ( and ‹expr›* )
      ( or ‹expr›* )

      ( cond {[ ‹expr› ‹expr›* ]}* )
      ;; The last clause can use `else` as a synonym for a `#t` test expression.
    #+end_src
    + ~[~ and ~]~ are interchangeable with ~(~ and ~)~, as long as ~(~ can matche ~)~,
      and ~[~ can matche ~]~. Their usages in the ~cond~ sytnax are the convention
      of Racket.

*** DONE 2.2.6 Function Calls, Again
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:45]
    The grammar of /function calls/ in the previous section 2.2.4 is
    _oversimplified_. The general syntax is:
    #+begin_src racket
      ( <expr> <expr>* )
    #+end_src

*** DONE 2.2.7 Anonymous Functions with ~lambda~
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:50]
    Syntax
    #+begin_src racket
      ( lambda ( <id>* ) <expr>+ )
    #+end_src
    - *if possible*, the compiler *infers* a _NAME_, anyway,
      TO make printing and error reporting as informative as possible.
      #+begin_src racket
        (define (louder s)
          (string-append s "!"))

        (define louder
          (lambda (s)
            (string-append s "!")))
      #+end_src
      When evaluate ~louder~ from each of the definitions above, we can get
      ~#<procedure:louder>~.

*** DONE 2.2.8 Local Binding with ~define~, ~let~, and ~let*~
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 03:56]

    - /Local binding/ with ~define~
      #+begin_src racket
        ( define ( ‹id› ‹id›* ) ‹definition›* ‹expr›+ )
        ( lambda ( ‹id›* ) ‹definition›* ‹expr›+ )
      #+end_src

    - /Local binding/ with ~let~:
      #+begin_src racket
        ( let ( {[ ‹id› ‹expr› ]}* ) ‹expr›+ )
      #+end_src
      The bindings of a ~let~ form are available *ONLY* in the BODY of the ~let~.
      * ~let*~, in contrast, allows LATER /binding clauses/ to use EARLIER /bindings/.

** DONE 2.3 Lists, Iteration, and Recursion
   CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 10:46]
   - /List/ construction: ~list~

   - ~length~, ~list-ref~, ~append~, ~reverse~, and ~member~

*** DONE 2.3.1 Predefined List Loops
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 10:34]
    - ~map~

    - ~andmap~ and ~ormap~

    - ~map~, ~andmap~, and ~ormap~ can handle multiple /lists/:
      #+begin_src racket
        (map (lambda (s n) (substring s 0 n))
             (list "peanuts" "popcorn" "crackerjack")
             (list 6 3 7))

      #+end_src

    - =TODO=
      /List comprehensions/ and related _iteration forms_ are described in
      "Iterations and Comprehensions".

*** DONE 2.3.2 List Iteration from Scratch
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 10:37]
    - A /Racket list/ is a /linked list/, the _two_ core operation on a _non-empty_
      /list/ are:
      + ~first~
      + ~rest~

    - ~cons~

    - ~empty?~ and ~cons?~

*** DONE 2.3.3 Tail Recursion
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 10:41]
*** DONE 2.3.4 Recursion versus Iteration
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 10:45]

** DONE 2.4 Pairs, Lists, and Racket Syntax - =RE-READ=
   CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 20:56]
   - ~cons~ can accept *ANY* TWO values, *NOT* just a /list/ for the _second_
     argument.

   - In general, the results of ~cons~ are /pairs/.
     + Of course, /lists/ are /paris/.

   - If a /pair/ is not a /list/, it will be printed with dots.

   - The more traditional name for the ~cons?~ is ~pair?~.

   - Racket's /pair/ _datatype_ and its relation to /lists/ is essentially a
     _historical curiosity_, along with the /dot notation/ for printing and the
     funny names ~car~ and ~cdr~.
       /Pairs/ are deeply wired into to the culture, specification, and
     implementation of Racket, however, so they survive in the language.
     + You are perhaps most likely to encounter a /non-list pair/ *when making a
       mistake*

     + /Non-list pairs/ are used _intentionally_, sometimes.
       * For example, =TODO= =???=
         the ~make-hash~ function takes a /list/ of /pairs/, where
         - the ~car~ of each /pair/ is a _key_
         - the ~cdr~ is an arbitrary value.

   - The only thing more confusing to new Racketeers than /non-list pairs/ is
     _the printing convention for /pairs/_ where the _SECOND_ element is a
     /pair/, but is *NOT* a /list/:
     #+begin_src racket
       (cons 0 (cons 1 2))
       ;; '(0 1 . 2)
     #+end_src
     + In general, the rule for printing a /pair/ is as follows:
       use the /dot notation/ unless the dot is immediately followed by an open
       parenthesis.
         In that case, remove the dot, the open parenthesis, and the matching
       close parenthesis. Thus, ~'(0 . (1 . 2))~ becomes ~'(0 1 . 2)~, and
       ~'(1 . (2 . (3 . ())))~ becomes ~'(1 2 3)~.
       - =from Jian=
         I think the rule described above is not very clear. I rephrase it _from
         the point of view of reduction_ as:
         A dot notation can be removed TOGETHER with its immediately following
         open parenthesis.

*** DONE 2.4.1 Quoting Pairs and Symbols with ~quote~
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 11:19]
    - A /list/ prints with a _quote mark_ BEFORE it,
      BUT if an element of a /list/ is ITSELF a /list/,
      then *no* _quote mark_ is printed for the INNER /list/:
      #+begin_src racket
        (list (list 1) (list 2 3) (list 4))
        ;; '((1) (2 3) (4))
      #+end_src

    - For /nested lists/, especially, the /quote form/ lets you write a /list/ as
      an /expression/ in essentially *the same way that the /list/ PRINTS*:
      #+begin_src racket
        (quote ("red" "green" "blue"))
        ; '("red" "green" "blue")

        (quote ((1) (2 3) (4)))
        ; '((1) (2 3) (4))

        (quote ())
        ; '()
      #+end_src

    - The ~quote~ form works with the /dot notation/, too:
      #+begin_src racket
        (quote (1 . 2))
        ; '(1 . 2)

        (quote (0 . (1 . 2)))
        ; '(0 1 . 2)
      #+end_src

    - Symbol :: A value that prints like a /quoted identifier/

    - ~symbol?~

    - Indeed, the intrinsic value of a /symbol/ is _NOTHING MORE THAN_ its character
      content. In this sense, /symbols/ and /strings/ are _ALMOST the same thing_, and
      the MAIN *difference* is _how they print_.
      + ~symbol -> string~
      + ~string -> symbol~

    - ~quote~ for a /list/ AUTOMATICALLY applies itself to /nested lists/,
    - ~quote~ on a _parenthesized sequence_ of /identifiers/ AUTOMATICALLY applies
      itself to the /identifiers/ to *create* _a /list/ of /symbols/._
      
    - When a /symbol/ is *inside* a /list/ that is printed with ', the ' on the
      /symbol/ is *omitted*, since ' is doing the job already:
      #+begin_src racket
        (quote (road map)
        ; '(road map)
      #+end_src

    - The ~quote~ form has *no effect* on a /literal expression/
      such as a /number/ or /string/.

*** DONE 2.4.2 Abbreviating ~quote~ with ~'~
    CLOSED: [2020-10-08 Thu 11:24]
    - In the *documentation*, ' within an /expression/ is printed _in green along
      with the form after it_, since the combination is an /expression/ that is a
      /constant/.

    - In *DrRacket*, _ONLY the ' is colored green_. DrRacket is more precisely
      correct, because the meaning of /quote/ can vary depending on the context of
      an expression.
        In the documentation, however, we routinely assume that standard bindings
      are in scope, and so we paint /quoted forms/ in green for extra clarity.

    - A ~'~ expands to a ~quote~ form in _quite a literal way_.
      You can see this if you put a ~'~ in front of a form that has a ~'~:
      #+begin_src racket
        (car ''road)
        ;; 'quote

        (car '(quote road))
        ;; 'quote
      #+end_src
      From the second expression we know, ~''road~ is expanded as
      ~(quote (quote road))~, which is a /list/ that has _TWO_ element ~'quote~
      and ~'road~.

*** DONE 2.4.3 Lists and Racket Syntax
    CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 20:22]
    - The syntax of Racket is *NOT* defined directly in terms of /character streams/.
      Instead, the syntax is determined by *TWO layers*:
      + a *reader layer*, which *turns* _a sequence of characters_ *into* /lists/,
        /symbols/, and _other constants_; and

      + an *expander layer*, which processes the /lists/, /symbols/, and _other
        constants_ to *parse* them *as* an /expression/.

    - One consequence of the *read layer* for /expressions/ is that you can use
      the dot notation in expressions that are not quoted forms:
      #+begin_src racket
        (+ 1 . (2))  ; 3
      #+end_src
      + It is practically *NEVER a good idea* to write application expressions
        using this _dot notation_; it's just a consequence of the way Racket's
        syntax is defined.
        
      + Normally, ~.~ is allowed by the /reader/
        * ONLY with a _parenthesized sequence_,
        * ONLY *BEFORE the last element* of the _sequence_.

      + However, a /pair/ of ~.~'s can also appear around a _SINGLE element_ in a
        _parenthesized sequence_, as long as the element is *NOT* first or last.
        Such a /pair/ triggers a /reader/ conversion that moves the element between
        ~.~'s *to the front* of the /list/.

      + The conversion enables a kind of general infix notation:
        #+begin_src racket
          (1 . < . 2)   ; #t
          '(1 . < . 2)  ; '(< 1 2)
        #+end_src

     + An /exact number/ is either
       * An _ARBITRARILY_ large or small /integer/;
       * A /rational/ that is exactly the ratio of two _ARBITRARILY_ /integers/;
       * A /complex number/ with *exact* /real/ and /imaginary/ parts (where the
         imaginary part is not zero).

     + An /inexact number/ is either
       * _an *IEEE floating-point representation* of a /number/,_ such as ~2.0~
         or ~3.14e+87~, where the IEEE /infinities/ and /not-a-number/ are written
         ~+inf.0~, ~-inf.0~, and ~+nan.0~ (or ~-nan.0~);

       * a /complex number/ with /real/ and /imaginary/ parts that are /IEEE
         floating-point representations/. AS a special case, an /inexact complex
         number/ can have an *exact* ZERO /real/ part with an *inexact*
         /imaginary/ part.

   - /Inexact numbers/ print WITH a _decimal point_ or _exponent specifier_, and
     /exact numbers/ print _AS_ _integers_ and _fractions_.
     + The same conventions apply for reading /number constants/,
       but ~#e~ or ~#i~ can PREFIX a number to *force* its parsing as an /exact/
       or /inexact/ number. For example, ~#e0.5~.

     + The prefixes ~#b~, ~#o~, and ~#x~ specify _binary_, _octal_, and _hexadecimal_
       interpretation of digits. For example, ~#x03BB~ is ~995~.
   
   - Computations that involve *an inexact number produce inexact results*, so that
     inexactness acts as a kind of taint on numbers.

   - The procedures ~exact->inexact~ and ~inexact->exact~ convert between the
     two types of numbers.

   - /Inexact results/ are also produced by procedures such as ~sqrt~, ~log~, and
     ~sin~ when an /exact result/ would require representing /real numbers/ that
     are _NOT_ /rational/.
       Racket can represent only /rational numbers/ and /complex numbers/ with
     _rational parts_.

       comparing*.
     
     + ~eqv?~ (and therefore ~equal?~) procedure, in contrast, compares numbers

   - A /Racket character/ corresponds to a /Unicode scalar value/.
     + Roughly, a /scalar value/ is an /unsigned integer/ whose representation
       fits into *21 bits*, and that maps to some notion of a natural-language
       character or piece of a character.

     + Technically, a /scalar value/ is a simpler notion than the concept called a
       "character" in the Unicode standard, but it's an approximation that works
       well for many purposes.
         For example, any accented Roman letter can be represented as a /scalar
       value/, as can any common Chinese character.
   
   - Although *each Racket character corresponds to an integer*,
     the character datatype is separate from numbers.
     + Procedures convert between scalar-value numbers and the corresponding

   A /string/ is a *fixed-length array of characters*.

     a /keyword/ can be /quoted/ to produce a /value/.
     
   - The same term "keyword" is used in both cases, but we sometimes use /keyword
     value/ to refer more specifically to the result of a /quote-keyword expression/
     or of ~string->keyword~.

   - An /unquoted keyword/ is *not* an /expression/, just as an /unquoted identifier/
     does *not* produce a /symbol/:
     + Examples:
       #+begin_src racket
         not-a-symbol-expression
         ; not-a-symbol-expression: undefined;
         ;  cannot reference an identifier before its definition

         #:not-a-symbol-expression
         ; eval:2:0: #%datum: keyword misused as an expression
         ;   at: #:not-a-keyword-expression
       #+end_src
       
   - Despite their similarities, /keywords/ *are used in a different way* than
     /identifiers/ or /symbols/.
     #+begin_src racket
       (define dir (find-system-path 'temp-dir))  ; not '#:temp-dir

       (with-output-to-file (build-path dir "stuff.txt")
         (lambda () (printf "example\n"))
         ; optional #:mode argument can be 'text or 'binary
         #:mode 'text
         ; optional #:exists argument can be 'replace, 'truncate, ...
         #:exists 'replace)
     #+end_src
     /Keywords/ are intended for use (_unquoted_) AS *special markers* _in
     /argument lists/ and in CERTAIN syntactic forms._
     + For /run-time flags/ and /enumerations/, use /symbols/ instead of /keywords/.
     + The example above illustrates the DISTINCT roles of /keywords/ and /symbols/.

     + More precisely, a /list/ is
       * EITHER the /empty list/ ~null~,
       * OR it is a /pair/:
         - whose FIRST element is a /list element/
         - whose SECOND element is a /list/.

     + The ~list?~ /predicate/ recognizes /lists/.
     + The ~null?~ /predicate/ recognizes the /empty list/.
     
   - A /list/ or /pair/ prints using ~list~ or ~cons~ when one of its elements
     *CANNOT* be written as a /quoted value/.
       For example, a value constructed with ~srcloc~ *CANNOT* be written using
     /quote/, and it prints using ~srcloc~ (=from Jian= Learn more about ~srcloc~):
     #+begin_src racket
       (srcloc "file.rkt" 1 0 1 (+ 4 4))
       ; (sorloc "file.rkt" 1 0 1 8)

     As shown in the last example, ~list*~ is used to abbreviate a series of
     ~cons~'es that *CANNOT* be abbreviated using ~list~.
     + =from Jian=
       From "The Racket Reference":
       * ~list*~ is like ~list~,
         BUT the _last argument_ is used _as the /tail/_ of the result, _INSTEAD
         OF the final element_.
       * The result of a ~list*~ expression is a /list/ *iff* the _last argument_
         is a /list/.
     
   - The ~write~ and ~display~ functions _PRINT_ a /pair/ or /list/ _WITHOUT_ a
     leading ~'~, ~cons~, ~list~, or ~list*~.
       There is *NO DIFFERENCE* between ~write~ and ~display~ for a /pair/ or
     /list/, *EXCEPT as they apply to elements of the /list/*:
     #+begin_src racket
       (write (cons 1 2))        ; (1 . 2)
       (display (cons 1 2))      ; (1 . 2)
       (write null)              ; ()
       (display null)            ; ()

       ;; Be careful about their difference!!!
       (write (list 1 2 "3"))    ; (1 2 "3")
       (display (list 1 2 "3"))  ; (1 2 3)
     #+end_src
     
   - Among the most important _PREDEFINED_ /procedures/ on /lists/ are those that
     iterate through the /list/'s elements:

   - /Pairs/ are *immutable* (*contrary* to _Lisp tradition_), and ~pair?~ and

   - The ~mcons~ procedure _CREATES_ a /mutable pair/, which works with ~set-mcar!~

** DONE 3.10 Hash Tables - =TODO=
   CLOSED: [2020-10-09 Fri 02:56]
   - /Keys/ are *compared* using ~equal?~, ~eqv?~, or ~eq?~,
     _DEPENDING ON_ whether the /hash table/ is created with ~make-hash~,
     ~make-hasheqv~, or ~make-hasheq~.
     + Example:
       #+begin_src racket
         (define ht (make-hash))

         (hash-set! ht "apple" '(red round))
         (hash-set! ht "banana" '(yellow long))

         ;;   key: "coconut"
         (hash-ref ht "coconut" "not there")  ;; "not there"
       #+end_src

   - The ~hash~, ~hasheqv~, and ~hasheq~ functions create /immutable hash tables/
     from an initial set of /keys/ and /values/, in which each /value/ is provided
     as an argument *after* its /key/. /Immutable hash tables/ can be extended with
     ~hash-set~, which produces a *NEW* /immutable hash table/ in *CONSTANT time*.
     + Example:
       #+begin_src racket
         (define ht (hash "apple" 'red "banana" 'yellow))
         (hash-ref ht "apple")  ;; 'red
         (define ht2 (hash-set ht "coconut" 'brown))
         (hash-ref ht2 "coconut")  ;; 'brown
       #+end_src

   - A /literal immutable hash table/ can be written as an /expression/ by using
     ~#hash~ (for an ~equal?~-based table), ~#hasheqv~ (for an ~eqv?~-based table),
     or ~#hasheq~ (for an ~eq?~-based table).
       A parenthesized sequence must _immediately follow_ ~#hash~, ~#hasheq~, or
     ~#hasheqv~, where EACH element is a /dotted key–value pair/. The ~#hash~, etc.
     forms *implicitly quote* their /key/ and /value/ sub-forms.
     + Example:
       #+begin_src racket
         (define ht #hash(("apple" . red)
                          ("banana" . yellow)))

         (hash-ref ht "apple")  ;; 'red
       #+end_src

     #+begin_src racket
       #hash(("apple" . red)
             ("banana" . yellow))
       ;; '#hash(("apple" . red) ("banana" . yellow))

       (hash 1 (srcloc "file.rkt" 1 0 1 (+ 4 4)))
       ;; (hash 1 (srcloc "file.rkt" 1 0 1 8))
     #+end_src
     + using a quoted ~#hash~, ~#hasheqv~, or ~#hasheq~ form
        IF all /keys/ and /values/ can be expressed with ~quote~
       OR
     + using ~hash~, ~hasheq~, or ~hasheqv~ otherwise

   - A /mutable hash table/ can optionally retain its keys weakly, so each mapping
     is retained only so long as the key is retained elsewhere.
     + Examples:
       #+begin_src racket
         (define ht (make-weak-hasheq))
         (hash-set! ht (gensym) "can you see me?")

   - =TODO= =???= =TODO= - =TODO= =???= =TODO= - =TODO= =???= =TODO= - =TODO= =???= =TODO=
     Beware that even a weak hash table retains its values strongly, as long as
     the corresponding key is accessible. This creates a catch-22 dependency
     when a value refers back to its key, so that the mapping is retained
     permanently. To break the cycle, map the key to an ephemeron that pairs the
     value with its key (in addition to the implicit pairing of the hash table).
     #+begin_src racket
       (define ht (make-weak-hasheq))

       (let ([g (gensym)])

   - The value of /the ~quote~ form/ is the _same value_ that ~read~ would produce
     given ~datum~.

   - The ~datum~ can be a /symbol/, a /boolean/, a /number/, a /(character or byte)
     string/, a /character/, a /keyword/, an /empty list/, a /pair (or list)/
     containing more SUCH values, a /vector/ containing more SUCH values, a /hash
     table/ containing more SUCH values, or a /box/ containing another SUCH value.
     + =from Jian=
       Here _SUCH_ means the values mentioned before in this paragraph.

   - A ~datum~ *cannot be* a printed representation that starts with ~#<~,
     so it *cannot be* ~#<void>~, ~#<undefined>~, or a /procedure/.

** DONE 4.11 Quasiquoting: ~quasiquote~ and ~`~ - =RE-READ=
   CLOSED: [2020-10-23 Fri 03:55]
   The ~quasiquote~ form is similar to ~quote~:
   #+begin_src racket
     (quasiquote datum)
   #+end_src
   
   - However, for each ~(unquote expr)~ that appears within the _datum_, the _expr_
     is evaluated to produce a value that *takes the place of* _the ~unquote~
     sub-form._
     + Example:
       #+begin_src racket
         (quasiquote (1 2 (unquote (+ 1 2)) (unquote (- 5 1))))
         ; '(1 2 3 4)
       #+end_src

   - This form can be used to write functions that
     *build* /lists/ *according to* certain patterns.
     + Example:
       #+begin_src racket
         (define (deep n)
           (cond
             [(zero? n) 0]

       #+end_src
       =from Jian=
       This is just a illustration, no the best solution.
         At least, the expression ~(list n (deep1 (- n 1)))~ can be used to
       replace the _quasiquote expression_ above, and it is looks simpler.

   - Or even to cheaply construct expressions programmatically. (Of course, 9 times
     out of 10, you should be using a /macro/ to do this (the 10th time being when
     you're working through a textbook like PLAI).)
     + Example:
       #+begin_src racket
         (define (build-exp n)
           (add-lets n (make-sum n)))

       #+end_src
     
   - The ~unquote-splicing~ form is similar to unquote, but
     + its _expr_ *must* produce a /list/, and
     + the ~unquote-splicing~ form *must* appear in a context that produces either
       a /list/ or a /vector/.

   - As the name suggests, the resulting /list/ is *spliced into* the context of
     its use.
     + Example:
       #+begin_src racket
         (quasiquote (1 2 (unquote-splicing (list (+ 1 2) (- 5 1))) 5))
         ; '(1 2 3 4 5)

     above to have just a _SINGLE ~let~ expression_ and a _single ~+~ expression_.

       #+end_src

   - If a ~quasiquote~ form appears *within an enclosing* ~quasiquote~ form, then
     the *inner* ~quasiquote~ effectively *CANCELS* _one layer_ of ~unquote~ and
     ~unquote-splicing~ forms, so that a *second* ~unquote~ or ~unquote-splicing~
     is needed.
     + Examples:

       (equal? (lead 1 2) (lead 1 2))  ;; #t
     #+end_src

     - The _first_ function in the list implements the ~equal?~ test on TWO ~lead~'s;
       + the _third argument_ to the function is used instead of ~equal?~ for
         _recursive equality testing_, so that data cycles can be handled correctly.

       + The other two functions compute primary and secondary hash codes for use
         with hash tables:
         #+begin_src racket
           > (define h (make-hash))
           > (hash-set! h (lead 1 2) 3)

           3

           > (hash-ref h (lead 2 1))
           hash-ref: no value found for key

           key: #<lead>
         #+end_src

     - The first function provided with gen:equal+hash is not required to recursively
       compare the fields of the structure. For example, a structure type
       representing a set might implement equality by checking that the members of
       the set are the same, independent of the order of elements in the internal
       representation. Just take care that the hash functions produce the same
       value for any two structure types that are supposed to be equivalent.

   EACH TIME that a ~struct~ form is _evaluated_, it generates a /structure type/
   that is *distinct* from ALL EXISTING /structure types/, even if some other
   /structure type/ has the SAME _name_ and _fields_.
   =from Jian=
   This is the same as any other well designed modern programming languages.

   - BEWARE of placing a ~struct~ form in positions that are _evaluated MULTIPLE

** TODO 5.7 Prefab Structure Types
   - Although a transparent structure type prints in a way that shows its content,
     the printed form of the structure cannot be used in an expression to get
     the structure back, unlike the printed form of a number, string, symbol, or
     list.

   - A prefab (“previously fabricated”) structure type is a built-in type that is
     known to the Racket printer and expression reader. Infinitely many such
     types exist, and they are indexed by name, field count, supertype, and
     other such details. The printed form of a prefab structure is similar to a
     vector, but it starts #s instead of just #, and the first element in the
     printed form is the prefab structure type’s name.

   - The following examples show instances of the sprout prefab structure type that
     has one field. The first instance has a field value 'bean, and the second has
     field value 'alfalfa:

  - reusable libraries

** TODO 6.1 Module Basics
   Each Racket /module/ _TYPICALLY_ resides in its own file.

   - For example, suppose the file "cake.rkt" contains the following /module/:
     #+begin_src racket
       #lang racket
       ;; cake.rkt

       (provide print-cake)

     #+end_src
     + The ~provide~ EXPLICITLY *exports* the definition ~print-cake~.
     + Since ~show~ is NOT exported, it is *private* to "cacke.rkt".

   - The following _"random-cake.rkt"_ /module/ imports _"cake.rkt"_:

       ;; random-cake.rkt

       (require "cake.rkt")

       (print-cake (random 30))
     #+end_src
     + The *RELATIVE reference* _"cake.rkt"_ in the import ~(require "cake.rkt")~
       works if the _"cake.rkt"_ and _"random-cake.rkt"_ /modules/ are in the *SAME
       directory*.

       platforms, much like relative URLs in HTML pages.

*** DONE 6.1.1 Organizing Modules
    CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 02:23]
    - The _"cake.rkt"_ and _"random-cake.rkt"_ example demonstrates the _MOST
      COMMON WAY_ to organize a program into /modules/:
      1. put ALL /module files/ in *a SINGLE directory* (perhaps with subdirectories),
      2. then have the /modules/ reference each other through /relative paths/.

    - _A directory of /modules/_ can act as a /project/, since it can be moved
      around on the filesystem or copied to other machines, and /relative paths/
      preserve the connections among /modules/.
      
    - Another Example: Build a _candy-sorting program_.
      =from Jian= Check the offical document, there is a figure.
      + You might have a *MAIN _"sort.rkt"_ /module/* that uses OTHER /modules/
         to _ACCESS a candy database_ and a _CONTROL sorting machine_.
      
        * If the _candy-database /module/_ itself is organized into /sub-modules/
          that _handle barcode_ and _manufacturer information_, then the _database
          /module/_ could be _"db/lookup.rkt"_ that uses HELPER /modules/
          _"db/barcodes.rkt"_ and _"db/makers.rkt"._

        * Similarly, the _sorting-machine driver_ _"machine/control.rkt"_ might use
          HELPER /modules/ _"machine/sensors.rkt"_ and _"machine/actuators.rkt"_.

      + Code
        * "sort.rkt"
          #+begin_src racket
            #lang racket
            (require "db/lookup.rkt" "machine/control.rkt")
          #+end_src
          
        * "dp/lookup.rkt"
          #+begin_src racket

            (require "barcode.rkt" "makers.rkt")
          #+end_src
          
        * "machine/control.rkt"
          #+begin_src racket
            #lang racket
            (require "sensors.rkt" "actuators.rkt")
          #+end_src
          
      + How to run it:
        * ~racket sort.rkt~
          Racket tools all work AUTOMATICALLY with /relative paths/.
          
        * ~raco make sort.rkt~
          ~racket sort.rkt~
          With a large enough program, compilation from source can take too long,
          so
          1. use the first command to compile "sort.rkt" and all its /dependencies/
             to _bytecode files_.

          2. run it with the second command, it will automatically use _bytecode files_
             when they are present.
    
*** DONE 6.1.2 Library Collections
    CLOSED: [2020-10-22 Thu 02:36]
    A /collection/ is *a HIERARCHICAL GROUPING of INSTALLED library /modules/.*

    - A /module/ in a /collection/ is referenced through an /unquoted, suffixless
      path/. 
      + For example,
        #+begin_src racket
          #lang racket

          (require racket/date)

          (printf "Today is ~s\n"
                  (date->string (second->date (current-seconds))))
        #+end_src
        
    - In the online Racket documentation,
      The search results indicate the /module/ that provides each /binding/.
      Hover over the /binding/ name to find out which /modules/ provide it.

    - A /module reference/ like ~racket/date~ looks LIKE an identifier, BUT it is
      NOT treated in the same way as ~printf~ or ~date->string~.
        Instead, when ~require~ sees a /module reference/ that is *unquoted*, it
      _CONVERTS_ the reference to a /collection-based module path/:
      1. if the /unquoted path/ contains no ~/~, then ~require~ AUTOMATICALLY
         *adds* a ~"/main"~ to the reference.
         + For example,
           ~(require slideshow)~ is equivalent to ~(require slideshow/main)~.

      2. ~require~ IMPLICITLY *adds* a ~".rkt"~ suffix to the path.

      3. ~require~ *resolves* the path *by searching* among /INSTALLED collections/,
        *INSTEAD of* treating the path as relative to the enclosing module's path.
        
    - To a first approximation, a /collection/ is implemented as a filesystem
      directory.
      + For example,
        the ~"racket"~ /collection/ is mostly located in a ~"racket"~ directory
        within the /Racket installation's "collects" directory/, as reported by
        #+begin_src racket
          #lang racket

          (require setup/dirs)

          (build-path (find-collects-dir)  ; main collection directory
                    "racket")
        #+end_src
        
      + The /Racket installation's "collects" directory/, however, is _only one
        place_ that require looks for /collection/ DIRECTORIES.
        * Other places include the /user-specific directory/ reported by
          ~(find-user-collects-dir)~ and _directories configured_ through the
          ~PLTCOLLECTS~ search path.
        * Finally, and *most typically*, /collections/ are found through /installed
          packages/.

   - SYNTAX:
     #+begin_src racket
       (provide provide-spec ...)
     #+end_src

   - A ~provide~ form can *only* appear *at /module/ level* (i.e., in the *IMMEDIATE
     body* of a ~module~).
     + Specifying MULTIPLE =provide-spec='s in a SINGLE ~provide~
       *is exactly the same as*
       using MULTIPLE ~provide~'s each with a SINGLE =provide-spec=.

   - Each ~identifier~ can be exported *at most once* from a ~module~ across ALL
     ~provide~'s within the ~module~. More precisely,
     + the EXTERNAL NAME for each *export* must be _DISTINCT_;

     + the SAME internal /binding/ _can be *exported* MULTIPLE times with
       DIFFERENT external names._

   - The allowed shape of a =provide-spec= is defined _RECURSIVELY_:
     + ~identifier~
       In its simplest form, a =provide-spec= indicates a /binding/ within its
       ~module~ to be *exported*. The /binding/ can be from either a /local
       definition/, or from an /import/.

     + ~(rename-out [orig-id export-id] ...)~
       A rename-out form is similar to just specifying an identifier, but the
       exported binding orig-id is given a different name, export-id, to
       importing modules.

     + ~(struct-out struct-id)~
       A struct-out form exports the bindings created by
       ~(struct struct-id ....)~.

     + ~(all-defined-out)~
       + The all-defined-out shorthand exports all bindings that are defined within
         the exporting module (as opposed to imported).

       + Use of the all-defined-out shorthand is generally discouraged, because
         it makes less clear the actual exports for a module, and because Racket
         programmers get into the habit of thinking that definitions can be
         added freely to a module without affecting its public interface (which
         is not the case when all-defined-out is used).

     + ~(all-from-out module-path)~
       * The all-from-out shorthand exports all bindings in the module that were
         imported using a require-spec that is based on module-path.

       * Although different module-paths could refer to the same file-based module,
         re-exporting with all-from-out is based specifically on the module-path
         reference, and not the module that is actually referenced.

     + ~(except-out provide-spec id ...)~
       Like =provide-spec=, but omitting the export of each id, where id is the
       external name of the binding to omit.

     + ~(prefix-out prefix-id provide-spec)~
       Like =provide-spec=, but adding prefix-id to the beginning of the external
       name for each exported binding.

  This chapter provides a GENTLE introduction to /Racket's contract system/.

** DONE 7.1 Contracts and Boundaries
   CLOSED: [2020-10-10 Sat 21:32]
   A /software contract/ is an agreement between two parties.
   The agreement specifies _obligations_ and _guarantees_ for each "product" (or
   value) that is handed from one party to the other.

   - A /contract/ thus establishes a _boundary between the two parties_.
     Whenever a value crosses this boundary, _the /contract/ monitoring system_
     performs /contract/ checks, making sure the partners abide by the established
     /contract/.

   - In this spirit, *Racket _ENCOURAGES_ /contracts/ mainly at _module boundaries_.*
     Specifically, programmers may attach /contracts/ to ~provide~ clauses and thus
     impose CONSTRAINTS and PROMISES on the use of *exported values*.
     For example, the export specification
     #+begin_src racket
       #lang racket

       (provide (contract-out [amount positive?]))
       (deinfe amount ...)
     #+end_src

   - _The /contracts/ library_ is built into the Racket language,
     BUT if you wish to use ~racket/base~, you can EXPLICITLY ~require~ the
     ~contracts~ library like this:
     #+begin_src racket
       #lang racket/base

       (require racket/contract)  ;; now we can write contracts

       (provide (contract-out [amount positive?]))

    If we bind ~amount~ to a number that is not positive,

      HOWEVER, if define the value of ~amount~ with a non-number value, the error
      message is misleading -- it comes from the _contract system_, but from the
      /contract/ ~positive?~ instead of ~amount~. In general, this is not expected!
        We make the /contract/ capture our intensions for all Racket values, we
      can ensure that the value is *BOTH* a /number/ AND is /positive/, *combining*
      the two contracts with ~and/c~:

      + In the example in section 7.2.2 that uses ~any~, we know its result is
        ~void?~, however, if we write ~void?~, the /contract monitoring system/
        will check everytime.

    - The ~any/c~ /contract/ is *SIMILAR* to ~any~, in that it makes no demands on
      a value.
      *UNLIKE* ~any~, ~any/c~ indicates a single value, and it is suitable for
      use as an /argument contract/. Using ~any/c~ as a /range contract/ imposes
      a *CHECK* that the function produces a _SINGLE_ value.
      + For example, for function
        #+begin_src racket
          (define (f x) (values (+ x 1) (- x 1)))
        #+end_src
        can have contract ~(-> integer? any)~, NOT ~(-> integer? any/c)~.

    - Use ~any/c~ as a /result contract/ when it is *particularly important* to
      _promise a single result_ from a function.

    - Use ~any~ when you want to
      promise *as little as possible* (and *incur as little checking as
      possible*) for a function's result.

    - The ~deposit~ function adds the given number to the value of ~amount~.
      The /function's contract/
      + *prevents* clients from applying it to _non-numbers_,
      + still *allows* them to apply the function to /complex numbers/, /negative
         numbers/, or /inexact numbers/, _none of which sensibly represent
        amounts of money._

    - The contract system allows programmers to define their own /contracts/ as
      functions:
      #+begin_src racket
        #lang racket

        (define (amount? a)
          (and (number? a) (integer? a) (exact? a) (>= a 0)))

        (provide (contract-out
                  ; an amount is a natural number of cents
                  ; is the given number an amount?
                  [deposit (-> amount? any)]
                  [amount? (-> any/c boolean?)]
                  [balance (-> amount?)]))

        (define amount 0)
        (define (deposit a) (set! amount (+ amount a)))
        (define (balance) amount)
      #+end_src
      + We can also use the built-in ~natural-number/c~ in place of ~amount?~.

    - Every function that accepts one argument can be treated as a predicate and
      thus used as a contract. For combining existing checks into a new one,
      however, contract combinators such as and/c and or/c are often useful. For
      example, here is yet another way to write the contracts above:
      #+begin_src racket
        (define amount/c
          (and/c number? integer? exact? (or/c positive? zero?)))

        (provide (contract-out
                  [deposit (-> amount/c any)]
                  [balance (-> amount/c)]))
      #+end_src

    - Other values also serve DOUBLE duty _AS_ /contracts/.
      For example,
      + ~(or/c positive? zero?)~ can be re-written as ~(or/c positive? 0)~

      + If use a /regular expression/ as a /contract/, the /contract/ accepts
        /strings/ and /byte strings/ that *match* this /regular expression/.

    - Naturally, you can mix your own contract-implementing functions with
      /combinators/ like ~and/c~.
        Here is a /module/ for creating /strings/ from banking records:
      #+begin_src racket
        #lang racket

        (define (has-decimal? str)
          (define L (string-length str))

               (char=? #\. (string-ref str (- L 3)))))

                  ; point, as in an amount of US currency

* TODO 8 Input and Output
  A Racket port represents a source or sink of data, such as a file, a terminal,
  a TCP connection, or an in-memory string. Ports provide sequential access in
  which data can be read or written a piece of a time, without requiring the
  data to be consumed or produced all at once. More specifically, an /input port/
  represents a source from which a program can read data, and an /output port/
  represents a sink to which a program can write data.
  
** 8.1 Varieties of Ports
   Various /functions/ create _various kinds of_ /ports/.
   Here are a few examples:
   
   - *Files*:
     The ~open-output-file~ function opens a file *for writing*, and
     the ~open-input-file~ opens a file *for reading*.

* TODO 10 Exceptions and Control
  Racket provides an especially rich set of control operations -- not only
  operations for *raising* and *catching* /exceptions/, but also operations for
  *grabbing* and *restoring* portions of a computation.
  
** DONE 10.1 Exceptions
   CLOSED: [2020-10-20 Tue 23:45]
   To *catch* an /exception/, use the ~with-handlers~ form: 
   #+begin_src racket
     (with-handlers ([predicate-expr handler-expr] ...)
       body ...+)
   #+end_src
   
   - Each _predicate-expr_ in a handler determines a kind of /exception/ that is
     caught by the ~with-handlers~ form, and the value representing the /exception/
     is passed to the handler procedure produced by _handler-expr_.
     + The result of the _handler-expr_ is the result of the ~with-handlers~
       expression.
     
   - For example,
     a _divide-by-zero error_ raises an instance of the
     ~exn:fail:contract:divide-by-zero~ /structure type/:
     #+begin_src racket
       (with-handlers ([exn:fail:contract:divide-by-zero?
                        (lambda (exn) +inf.0)])
         (/ 1 0))
       ; +inf.0


       (with-handlers ([exn:fail:contract:divide-by-zero?
                        (lambda (exn) +inf.0)])
         (car 17))
       ;; car: contract violation
       ;;   expected: pair?
       ;;   given: 17
     #+end_src
     
   - The ~error~ function is one way to *raise* your own /exception/.
     It packages _an error message_ and _other information_ into an ~exn:fail~
     structure:
     #+begin_src racket
       (error "crash!")
       ; crash!

       (with-handlers ([exn:fail? (lambda (exn) 'air-bag)])
         (error "crash!"))
       ; 'air-bag
     #+end_src
     
   - The ~exn:fail:contract:divide-by-zero~ and ~exn:fail~ /structure types/ are
     /sub-types/ of the ~exn~ /structure type/.
     
   - /Exceptions/ raised _by core forms and functions_ *ALWAYS* raise an instance
     of ~exn~ or one of its /sub-types/.

   - However, an /exception/ *does not have to be* represented by a /structure/.
     *The /raise/ function lets you raise ANY VALUE as an /exception/*:
     #+begin_src racket
       (raise 2)
       ;; uncaught exception: 2


       (with-handlers ([(lambda (v) (equal? v 2)) (lambda (v) 'two)])
         (raise 2))
       ; 'two

         (/ 1 0))
       ;; /: division by zero
     #+end_src
     
   - Multiple _predicate-exprs_ in a ~with-handlers~ form let you handle different
     kinds of exceptions in different ways.
       The /predicates/ are tried *in order*, and if none of them match, then
     the /exception/ is propagated to enclosing contexts.
     #+begin_src racket
       (define (always-fail n)
         (with-handlers ([even? (lambda (v) 'even)]
                         [positive? (lambda (v) 'positive)])
           (raise n)))

       (always-fail -3)
       ;; uncaught exception: -3

         (always-fail -3))
       ; 'negative
     #+end_src
    
   - Using ~(lambda (v) #t)~ as a /predicate/ *captures all* /exceptions/, of
     course:
     #+begin_src racket

         (car 17))
       ; 'oops
     #+end_src
     *Capturing all exceptions is usually a bad idea*, HOWEVER.
     + For example,
       if the user types Ctl-C in a terminal window or clicks the Stop button in
       DrRacket to interrupt a computation, then normally the ~exn:break~
       /exception/ *should NOT be caught*.

     + To catch *ONLY* /exceptions/ that represent /errors/, use ~exn:fail?~ as
       the /predicate/:
       #+begin_src racket
         (with-handlers ([exn:fail? (lambda (v) 'oops)])
           (car 17))
         ; 'oops

           (car 17))

      1. accumulates body results into a /list/,
      2. instead of evaluating body only for side effects.

  - The _full syntax_ of ~for~ _accommodates MULTIPLE sequences_ to iterate *in
    parallel*,
    AND
    the ~for*~ variant _NESTS the iterations_ *INSTEAD OF running them in
    parallel*.
    + More variants of ~for~ and ~for*~ accumulate body results in different ways.
      In all of these variants, /predicates/ that _prune iterations_ can be included
      along with /bindings/.

  - Before details on the variations of ~for~, though,
    it's best to see the kinds of /sequence generators/ that make interesting
    examples.

   The ~for/fold~ form is a VERY GENERAL WAY to *combine* iteration results.

   - ~for/fold~ syntax is *slightly different* than the syntax of ~for~,
     because /accumulation variables/ *must be declared* _at the beginning_:

   - In the simple case, only one ~[accum-id init-expr]~ is provided, and the result
     of the ~for/fold~ is the final value for _accum-id_, which starts out with the
     value of _init-expr_. In the _clauses_ and _bodys_, _accum-id_ can be
     referenced to get its current value, and the *LAST* ~body~ provides the value
     of _accum-id_ for the next iteration.

** DONE 11.8 Multiple-Valued Sequences
   CLOSED: [2020-10-20 Tue 18:07]
   - In the same way that a function or expression can produce multiple values,
     individual iterations of a sequence can produce multiple elements.

   - For example,
     a /hash table/ as a sequence generates two values for each iteration:
     a _key_ and a _value_.

   - In the same way that ~let-values~ binds multiple results to multiple identifiers,
     ~for~ can *bind* multiple sequence elements to multiple iteration identifiers:
     #+begin_src racket
       (for ([(k v) #hash(("apple" . 1) ("banana" . 3))])

       ; banana count: 3
       ; apple count: 1
     #+end_src
     
   - This extension to /multiple-value bindings/ works for *ALL* ~for~ variants.
     For example, ~for*/list~ nests iterations, builds a /list/, and also works
     with /multiple-valued sequences/:
     #+begin_src racket
       (for*/list ([(k v) #hash(("apple" . 1) ("banana" . 3))]

   - That is, a ~#:break~ or ~#:final~ clause can be included AMONG
     + the /binding clauses/
     + body of the iteration.

   - Among the /binding clauses/, ~#:break~ is like ~#:unless~ but when its
     _boolean-expr_ is /true/, all sequences within the for are stopped.

   - Among the /bodys/, ~#:break~ has the same effect on sequences when its
     _boolean-expr_ is /true/, and it also *prevents* _later bodys_ *from* evaluation
     in the current iteration.

   - For example, while using ~#:unless~ between clauses effectively *skips* _later
     sequences_ as well as the _body_,
     #+begin_src racket
       (for ([book '("Guide" "Story" "Reference")]

* DONE 12 Pattern Matching
  CLOSED: [2020-10-15 Thu 21:38]
  SYNTAX
  #+begin_src racket
    (match target-expr
      [pattern expr ...+] ...)
  #+end_src
  The ~match~ form takes the result of ~target-expr~ and tries to *match* each
  /pattern/ in order. As soon as it finds a _matched pattern_, it evaluates the
  corresponding ~expr~ sequence to obtain the result for the ~match~ form.

  - If /pattern/ includes /pattern variables/, they are treated like /wildcards/,
    and EACH /variable/ is *bound* in the ~expr~ *to* the _input fragments that it
    matched._

  - Examples:
    + Literal expression patterns:
      #+begin_src racket
        (match 2
          [1 'one]
          [2 'two]
          [3 'three])
        ; 'two
      #+end_src

    + Constructor patterns:
      #+begin_src racket
        (match '(1 2)
          [(list 0 1) 'one]
          [(list 1 2) 'two])
        ; 'two
      #+end_src

    + ~struct~ patterns:
      #+begin_src racket
        (struct shoe (size color))
        (struct hat (size style))

        (match (hat 23 'bowler)
          [(shoe 10 'white) "bottom"]
          [(hat 23 'bowler) "top"])
        ; "top"
      #+end_src

    + *Unquoted, non-constructor identifiers* in a /pattern/ are /pattern variables/
      that are BOUND IN the /result expressions/, except ~_~, which does _NOT bind_
      (and thus is usually used as a *catch-all*):
      #+begin_src racket
        (match '(1 2)
          [(list x) (+ x 1)]
          [(list x y) (+ x y)])
        ; 3

        (match (hat 11 'cowboy)
          [(shoe sz 'black) 'a-good-shoe]
          [(hat sz 'bowler) 'a-good-hat]
          [_                'something-else])
        ; 'something-else
      #+end_src

    + Ellipsis, ~...~, acts like a /Kleene start/ within a /list or vector pattern/:
      #+begin_src racket
        (match '(1 1 1)
          [(list 1 ...) 'ones]
          [_            'other])
        ; 'ones


        (match '(1 1 2)
          [(list 1 ...) 'ones]
          [_            'other])
        ; 'other


        (match '(1 2 3 4)
          [(list 1 x ... 4) x])
        ; '(2 3)


        (match (list (hat 23 'bowler) (hat 22 'pork-pie))
          [(list (hat sz styl) ...) (apply + sz)])
        ; 45
      #+end_src
      * /Ellipses/ can be _nested_ to *match* _nested repetitions_, and in that
        case, /pattern variables/ can be bound to /lists of lists/ of _matches_:
        #+begin_src racket
          (match '((! 1) (! 2 2) (! 3 3 3))
            [(list (list '! x ...) ...) x])
          '((1) (2 2) (3 3 3))
        #+end_src

    + The /quasiquote/ form (see "Quasiquoting": /quasiquote/ and ~`~ for more
      about it) can also be used to build /patterns/. While /unquoted/ portions
      of a normal /quasiquoted/ form mean regular racket evaluation, here
      /unquoted/ portions mean go back to regular /pattern matching/.
        So, in the example below, the with expression is the pattern and it gets
      rewritten into the application expression, using /quasiquote/ as a pattern
      in the first instance and /quasiquote/ to build an expression in the second.
      #+begin_src racket
        (match `{with {x 1} {+ x 1}}
          [`{with {,id ,rhs} ,body}
           `{{lambda {,id} ,body} ,rhs}])
        ; '((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 1)
      #+end_src

    + =TODO= For information on many more pattern forms, see ~racket/match~.

    + Forms like ~match-let~ and ~match-lambda~ support /patterns/ in positions
      that otherwise must be identifiers. =TODO= =TODO= =TODO=
      * For example, ~match-let~ generalizes ~let~ to a /destructing bind/:

          (match-let ([(list x y z) '(1 2 3)])
            (list z y x))

* TODO 16 Macros - _READING_
  - A /macro/ is a /syntactic form/ with an _associated transformer_ that
    *expands* the original form *into* existing forms.

  - To put it another way,
    a macro is an extension to the Racket compiler.

  - Most of the /syntactic forms/ of ~racket/base~ and ~racket~ are actually /macros/
    that *expand into* a small set of _core constructs_.

  - Like many languages,
    Racket provides /pattern-based macros/ that make simple transformations easy
    to implement and reliable to use.

  - Racket also supports arbitrary /macro transformers/ that are implemented in
    Racket -- or in a macro-extended variant of Racket.
    =TODO= ??? =TODO=

  - This chapter provides an introduction to Racket macros, but see _Fear of Macros_
    for an introduction from a different perspective.

*** DONE 16.1.1 ~define-syntax-rule~

   #+begin_src racket
     (define-syntax-rule pattern template)
   #+end_src

   - Example:
     #+begin_src racket

         (let ([tmp x])
           (set! x y)

            (set! other tmp_1))
          (list tmp other))
      #+end_src

*** DONE 16.1.3 ~define-syntax~ and ~syntax-rules~
    CLOSED: [2020-10-04 Sun 18:13]
    - Racket's macro system supports /transformers/ that _match *multiple* patterns_
      starting with the _SAME identifier_.
      + The ~define-syntax-rule~ form that binds a macro that _matches a *single*
        pattern_ is just a special case of the more general macros, and it will be
        expanded into ~define-syntax~ with a ~syntax-rules~ form.

    - The more general ~define-syntax~ form along with the ~syntax-rules~ /transformer/
      form:
      #+begin_src racket
        (define-syntax id
          (syntax-rules (literal-id ...)
            [pattern template]
            ...))
      #+end_src

    - If we want a functionality ~rotate~ that generalizes ~swap~ defined in the
      last section:
      #+begin_src racket
        (let ([red 1] [green 2] [blue 3])
          (rotate red green)      ; swaps
          (rotate red green blue) ; rotates left
          (list red green blue))
      #+end_src

      we can define a /macro/
      #+begin_src racket
        (define-syntax rotate
          (syntax-rules ()
            [(rotate a b) (swap a b)]
            [(rotate a b c) (begin
                              (swap a b)
                              (swap b c))]))
      #+end_src

*** DONE 16.1.4 Matching Sequences
    CLOSED: [2020-10-04 Sun 23:10]
    A better ~rotate~ /macro/ would allow any number of identifiers, instead of just
    two or three.

    - To match a use of ~rotate~ with *any number* of identifiers, we need a pattern
      form that has something like a /Kleene star/.
      + In a /Racket macro pattern/, a /star/ is written as ~...~.

    - To implement *rotate* with ~...~, we need
      1. a /base case/ to handle a single identifier,
      2. an /inductive case/ to handle more than one identifier:
      #+begin_src racket
        (define-syntax rotate
          (syntax-rules ()
            [(rotate a) (void)]
            [(rotate a b c ...) (begin
                                  (swap a b)
                                  (rotate b c ...))]))
      #+end_src
      + When a /pattern variable/ like ~c~ is followed by ~...~ in a /pattern/, then
        it *MUST* be followed by ~...~ in a /template/, too.

      + The /pattern variable/ effectively matches a sequence of *zero or more* forms,
        and it is replaced in the /template/ by the same sequence.

    - We can use ~...~ patterns to implement the *more efficient* variant using a
      /helper macro/:
      #+begin_src racket
        (define-syntax rotate
          (syntax-rules ()
            [(rotate a c ...)
             (shift-to (c ... a) (a c ...))]))

        (define-syntax shift-to
          (syntax-rules ()
            [(shift-to (from0 from ...) (to0 to ...))
             (let ([tmp from0])
               (set! to from) ...
               (set! to0 tmp))]))
      #+end_src
      + In the ~shift-to~ /macro/, ~...~ in the /template/ follows ~(set! to from)~,
        which causes the ~(set! to from)~ expression to be duplicated as many times
        as necessary to use each identifier matched in the ~to~ and ~from~ sequences.
        (The number of ~to~ and ~from~ matches *must be the same*, otherwise the
        /macro expansion/ fails with an error.)
