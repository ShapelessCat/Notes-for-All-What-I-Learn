  This book introduces Java's I/O capabilities as of Java 8 update 51.

  - Chapter 1
    A broad overview of Java's classic I/O, NIO, and NIO.2.

    You learn what each category offers in terms of its capabilities, and you
    also learn about concepts such as /paths/ and /Direct Memory Access/.

  - Chapter 2 ~ 5
    Cover *classic I/O* APIs.
    + ~File~

    + ~RandomAccessFile~ 

    along with /streams/ (including object *serialization* and *externalization*)
    and *writers/readers*.

  - Chapter 6 ~ 11
    *NIO*
    + /buffers/

    + /channels/

    + /selectors/

    + /regular expressions/

    + /charsets/

    + /formatters/, which were not introduced with the other NIO types in Java 1.4
      because they depend on the variable arguments capability that was
      introduced in Java 5.

  - Chapter 12 ~ 14
    *NIO.2*, which improves (add some features that NIO doesn't have but is
    really useful):
    + file system interface
    + asynchronous I/O
    + the completion of socket channel functionality

  - Appendix A
    The _answers and solutions_ to the exercises after every chapter.

  - Appendix B
    A tutorial on /sockets and network interfaces/.

   - *History*
     1. Java initial suite of I/O APIs and related architecture are known as
        classic I/O.

     2. Because modern operating systems feature newer I/O paradigms, which
        classic I/O doesn't support, new I/O (NIO) was introduced as part of JDK
        1.4 to support them.

     3. Lack of time prevented some planned NIO features from being included in
        this release, which led to these other NIO features being deferred to
        JDK 5 and JDK 7

** DONE Classic I/O - 3
   CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Mon 02:42]
   - JDK 1.0 introduced rudimentary I/O facilities for
     + *accessing* the /file system/, to
       * create a directory
       * remove a file
       * perform another task

     + *accessing* file content randomly (as _opposed to sequentially_);

     + *streaming* /byte-oriented data/ BETWEEN _sources_ AND _destinations_ in a
       /sequential manner/.

    CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Mon 01:51]
    - ~java.io.RandomAccessFile~ provides /random access/ to a /file/.
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        val raf = new RandomAccessFile("employees.dat", "r");
        int empIndex = 10;
        raf.seek(empIndex * EMP_REC_LEN);
        // Read contents of employee record.
      #+END_SRC

*** DONE Streaming Data via Stream Classes - 5
    CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Mon 02:39]
    - stream :: an ordered sequence of bytes of arbitrary length.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        try (val fis = new FileInputStream("image.jpg"))
        {
            // Read bytes from file.
            int _byte;
            while ((_byte = fis.read()) != -1) // -1 signifies EOF
            {
                // Process _byte in some way.
            }
        }
        catch (IOException ioe)
        {
            // Handle exception.
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - Example (with /buffer/ for improving performance):
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        try (val fis = new FileInputStream("image.jpg");
             val bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis))
        {
            // Read bytes from file.
            int _byte;
            while ((_byte = bis.read()) != -1) // -1 signifies EOF
            {
                // Process _byte in some way.
            }
        }
        catch (IOException ioe)
        {
            // Handle exception.
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - Chapter 4 expores the /stream classes/.
      =TODO=

**** DONE Stream Classes and Standard I/O - 5
     CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Mon 02:39]
     - Many operating systems support /standard I/O/, which is _preconnected_ /input
       and output data streams/ BETWEEN a _computer program_ AND _its environment_
       WHEN it begins execution.

       The /preconnected streams/ are known as /standard input/, /standard output/,
       and /standard error/.

     - /Standard input/ *defaults to reading* its input from the keyboard.

       /standard output/ and /standard error/ *default to writing* their output
       to the screen.

       However, these /streams/ can be *redirected* to read input from a
       different source and write output to a different destination (such as a
       file).

     - _JDK 1.0_ introduced support for /standard I\slash{}O/ by adding the ~in~, ~out~,
       and ~err~ objects of type ~InputStream~ and ~PrintStream~ to the ~java.lang.System~
       /class/. You specify /method/ calls on these objects to access /standard input/,
       /standard output/, and /standard error/, as follows:
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         int ch = System.in.read(); // Read single character from standard input.
         System.out.println("Hello"); // Write string to standard output.
         System.err.println("I/O error: " +
                            ioe.getMessage()); // Write string to standard error.
       #+END_SRC

     - As well as exploring ~InputStream~ and ~PrintStream~,
       Chapter 4 also _revisits_ /standard I/O/ to show you how to
       _programmatically_ *redirect* these /streams/.

*** DONE JDK 1.1 and the Writer/Reader Classes - 8
    CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Mon 02:41]
    - JDK 1.0's I/O capabilities are suitable for _streaming bytes_,

      BUT *CANNOT* properly _stream characters_ because they don't account for
      /character encodings/.

      JDK 1.1 overcame this problem by introducing /writer\slash{}reader classes/ that
      take /character encodings/ into account.
        For example, the ~java.io~ /package/ includes ~FileWriter~ and ~FileReader~
      /classes/ for writing and reading /character streams/.

    - Chapter 5 explores various /writer and reader classes/.
      =TODO=

** DONE NIO - 8
   CLOSED: [2018-07-26 Thu 19:01]
   - /Modern operating systems/ offer sophisticated I/O services (such as
     _readiness selection_ =???=) for *improving I/O performance and simplifying
     I/O*.

       /Java Specification Request (JSR) 51/ (www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=51) was
     created to address these capabilities.

   - JSR 51's description indicates that it provides APIs for
     + /scalable I\slash{}O/ =???=
     + /fast buffered binary and character I\slash{}O/
     + /regular expressions/
     + /charset conversion/.

     Collectively, these APIs are known as /NIO/.

   - _JDK 1.4_ *implemented* /NIO/ in terms of the following APIs:
     + Buffers
     + Channels
     + Selectors
     + Regular expressions
     + Charsets
     The /regular expression and charset APIs/ were provided to *simplify* _common
     I/O-related tasks_.

*** DONE Buffers - 9
    CLOSED: [2018-07-24 Tue 22:11]
    - /Buffers/ are the *foundation* for NIO operations.
      Essentially, NIO is _ALL about moving data INTO and OUT of buffers_.
      =IMPORTANT=
      + A process such as the JVM performs I/O by asking the OS to _drain_ a
        /buffer/'s contents to storage via a *write* operation.

      + Ask the OS to _fill_ a /buffer/ with data *read* from a storage device.

    - =TODO= NOTE =TODO=

    - Consider a read operation involving a disk drive.
      =TODO=

      1. The OS issues a command to the /disk controller/ to *read* a block of
         bytes _FROM_ a disk _INTO_ an /OS buffer/.

         Once this operation completes,
         the OS copies the /buffer/ contents to the /process buffer/ specified
         by the process when it issued a read() operation.

      2. In turn, the OS has requested to the /disk controller/ to *read* a block
         of bytes from the disk. The disk controller (also known as a DMA
         controller) reads these bytes directly into an operating system buffer
         via Direct Memory Access (DMA), a feature of computer systems that
         allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system (RAM) memory
         independently of the central processing unit (CPU). The operating
         system then copies these bytes to the process’s buffer.

    - Copying bytes _FROM_ the /OS buffer/ _TO_ the /process buffer/ is *NOT very
      efficient*.

        It would be _MORE performant_ to have the /DMA controller/ copy _directly_
      to the /process buffer/,

      _BUT there are *TWO problems* with this approach_:

      + The /DMA controller/ typically *CANNOT communicate directly* with the /user
        space/ in which the JVM process runs.
          Instead, it communicates with the OS's /kernel space/.

      + Block-oriented devices such as a /DMA controller/ work with _fixed-size data
        blocks_.
          IN CONTRAST,
        the /JVM process/ might request a size of data that is
        * *NOT a multiple* of the block size
          OR
        * that is /misaligned/.

      Because of these problems, the OS acts as an intermediary, _tearing apart_
      and _recombining_ data as it SWITCHES BETWEEN the /JVM process/ and the
      /DMA controller/.

    - =TODO= NOTE =TODO=

    - The data assembly/disassembly tasks can be made *more efficient* _BY_ letting
      the /JVM process/ *pass* _a list of buffer addresses_ *to* the OS in a SINGLE
      /system call/. The OS then *fills* or *drains* these /buffers/ in sequence,
      + *scattering* data *to* _MULTIPLE_ /buffers/ DURING a _read_ operation;
        OR
      + *gathering* data *from* SEVERAL /buffers/ DURING a _write_ operation.

      This scatter/gather activity
      *reduces* the number of (potentially expensive) /system calls/ that the JVM
      process must make
      _AND_
      lets the OS _optimize data handling_ because it knows the total amount of
      /buffer/ space.

      Furthermore, when _multiple processors or cores_ are available, the OS may
      allow /buffers/ to be _filled_ or _drained_ *SIMULTANEOUSLY*.

    - JDK 1.4's ~java.nio.Buffer~ /class/ abstracts the concept of a /JVM process
      buffer/. It serves as the /superclass/ for ~java.nio.ByteBuffer~ and /OTHER buffer
      classes/.

      Because I/O is fundamentally byte-oriented, *only* ~ByteBuffer~ instances can
      be used with /channels/ (which are discussed shortly).
        Most of the other ~Buffer~ /subclasses/ are *conveniences* for working with
      /multibyte data/ (such as /characters/ or /integers/).

    - =TODO=
      Chapter 6 explores the ~Buffer~ class and its children.

*** DONE Channels - 10
    CLOSED: [2018-07-25 Wed 11:36]
    - Forcing a CPU to perform I/O tasks and wait for I/O completions (such a
      CPU is said to be I/O bound) is *wasteful of this resource*.

      _Performance can be improved by offloading these tasks to DMA controllers
      so that the processor can get on with other work._

    - A /channel/ serves as a conduit for communicating (via the OS) with a /DMA
      controller/ to *EFFICIENTLY* _drain_ /byte buffers/ to or _fill_ /byte
      buffers/ from a disk.

    - JDK 1.4's ~java.nio.channels.Channel~ /interface/, its /subinterfaces/, and
      various /classes/ implement the /channel/ architecture.

    - One of these /classes/ is called ~java.nio.channels.FileChannel~, and it
      abstracts a /channel/ for _READING_, _WRITING_, _MAPPING_, and _MANIPULATING_
      a file.

      + One interesting feature of ~FileChannel~ is its support for /file locking/,
        upon which _sophisticated applications such as database management systems
        rely_. =from Jian= one usage -- explore this later =TODO=

        * /File locking/ lets a process *prevent* or *limit* access to a file while
          the process is accessing the file.

        * /File locking/ is OFTEN USED to lock _a region of a file_, although it can
          be applied to an entire file.

        *A lock ranges from a starting byte offset in the file and continues for
        a specific number of bytes.*

      + Another interesting ~FileChannel~ feature is *memory-mapped file I/O via the
        ~map()~ method.* ~map()~ returns a ~java.nio.MappedByteBuffer~ whose content is
        a _memory-mapped region_ (=TODO= =???=) of a file.
          File content is accessed via memory accesses; *buffer copies and read-write
        system calls are eliminated.*

    - You can obtain a /channel/ by calling the ~java.nio.channels.Channels~ /class/'s
      /methods/ or the methods in classic I/O classes such as ~RandomAccessFile~.

    - =TODO= Chapter 7 explores /Channel/, Channels, and more.

*** DONE Selectors - 11
    CLOSED: [2018-07-26 Thu 19:01]
    - I/O is classified as
      + /block-oriented/
        Example: Reading from or writing to a file.
        or
      + /stream-oriented/.
        Example: Reading from the keyboard or writing to a network connection.

    - /Stream I/O/ is *often slower* than /block I/O/.
      Further more, input tends to be _intermittent_.

      For example, the user might _pause_ while entering a /stream/ of characters
      or _momentary slowness_ in a network connection causes a playing video to
      proceed in a jerky fashion.

    - Many OS's allow /streams/ to be configured to operate in /nonblocking mode/
      in which a /thread/ continually checks for available input *WITHOUT blocking*
      when no input is available.
        The /thread/ can handle incoming data or perform other tasks until data
      arrives.

    - This "polling for available input" activity _can be *WASTEFUL*,_ especially
      when the /thread/ needs to monitor many input streams (such as in a web
      server context).

      Modern OS's can perform this checking _EFFICIENTLY_, which is known as
      /readiness selection/, and which is often built on top of /nonblocking mode/.
        The OS monitors a collection of /streams/ and returns an indication to the
      /thread/ of which /streams/ are ready to perform I/O.
        As a result, a single /thread/ can multiplex many active /streams/ via
      common code and makes it possible, in a web server context, to manage a
      huge number of network connections.

    - JDK 1.4 supports /readiness selection/ by providing /selectors/, which are
      instances of the ~java.nio.channels.Selector~ /class/ that can examine one
      or more /channels/ and determine which /channels/ are ready for reading or
      writing.
        This way a SINGLE /thread/ can manage MULTIPLE /channels/ (and, therefore,
      MULTIPLE network connections) *efficiently*. Being able to use *fewer* /threads/
      is advantageous where /thread/ creation and /thread/ context switching is
      expensive in terms of performance and/or memory use. See Figure 1-3.

      Figure 1-3. A thread manages three channels via a selector

    - =TODO= Chapter 8 explores Selector and its related types.

*** DONE Regular Expressions - 12
    CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Mon 03:07]
    - /Regular expressions/ were introduced as part of /NIO/.

    - =From Jian= This looks not that reasonable!
      Although you might wonder about the _rationale_ for doing this (what have
      /regular expressions/ got to do with I/O?), /regular expressions/ are commonly
      used to scan textual data that is read from a file or other source.

      The need to perform these scans as quickly as possible mandated their
      inclusion.

    - JDK 1.4 supports /regular expressions/ via the ~java.util.regex~ /package/
      and its ~Pattern~ and ~Matcher~ /classes/.

    - =TODO=
      Chapter 9 explores the ~Pattern~ and ~Matcher~ /classes/.

*** DONE Charsets - 13
    CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Mon 03:10]
    - I previously mentioned that JDK 1.1 introduced /writer/reader classes/ that
      take /character encodings/ into account.

    - Originally, /classes/ such as ~java.io.InputStreamReader~ worked with the
      ~java.io.ByteToCharConverter~ /class/ to perform *conversions based on
      encodings*.
        ~ByteToCharConverter~ was eventually *deprecated and removed from _JDK
      6_ and successors.*

    - In its place, the more capable ~java.nio.charset~ package along with its
      ~Charset~, ~CharsetEncoder~, ~CharsetDecoder~, and _related types_ was
      introduced.

    - =TODO=
      Chapter 10 explores the ~Charset~ /class/.

*** DONE Formatter - 13
    CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Mon 03:13]
    - /JSR 51/ mentions a simple printf-style formatting facility.

      Such a facility offers significant value in preparing data for
      presentation, to which many C programmers can attest.
        However, JDK 1.4 did *NOT* include this capability because it relies on
      /variable argument lists/, a language feature that did *NOT debut until
      JDK 5.*

      Fortunately, JDK 5 also included a ~java.util.Formatter~ /class/ with a
      wealth of formatting capabilities along with related types that support
      custom formatting, and added ~printf()~ (and related ~format()~) methods
      to the ~PrintStream~ /class/.

    - Chapter 11 explores ~Formatter~ and demonstrates ~printf()~.

** DONE NIO.2 - 13
   CLOSED: [2018-07-26 Thu 19:37]
   - /JSR 51/ specifies that NIO would *introduce an improved* /file system
     interface/ that *overcomes* various problems with the legacy ~File~
     /class/. *HOWEVER*,

     + lack of time prevented this feature from being included.

     + Also, it wasn't possible to support /asynchronous I\slash{}O/ and complete /socket
       channel/ functionality.

     /JSR 203/ (www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=203) was subsequently created to
     address these omissions, which debuted in *JDK 7*.

   - *NOTE* =TODO= =DETAILS=
     /big buffers (buffers with 64-bit addressability)/.

*** DONE Improved File System Interface - 14
    CLOSED: [2018-07-26 Thu 19:29]
    - The legacy ~File~ /class/ *suffers from various problems*.
      For example,
      + the ~renameTo()~ /method/ does *NOT* work *consistently* across OS's.
  
      + many of ~File~'s /methods/ do *NOT scale*;
        requesting a large directory listing from a server could result in a
        hang.

    - The _NEW_ /file system interface/ mentioned in /JSR 203/ fixes these and
      other problems.
      For example,
      + it
        * supports /bulk access/ to file attributes,
        * provides a change notification facility,
        * offers the ability to escape to file system-specific APIs, and
        * has a service provider interface for pluggable file system implementations.

*** DONE Completion of Socket Channel Functionality - 14
    CLOSED: [2018-07-26 Thu 19:37]
    - /JDK 1.4/ added the ~DatagramChannel~, ~ServerSocketChannel~, and
      ~SocketChannel~ /classes/ to the ~java.nio.channels~ /package/.

      *HOWEVER*,
      + lack of time prevented these classes from supporting /binding/ and /option

      + Also, /channel-based multicast/ datagrams were *not* supported.

    - /JDK 7/ added /binding/ support and /option configuration/ to the aforemen-

** DONE Summary - 15
   CLOSED: [2018-10-12 Fri 14:27]
   I/O is fundamental to OS's, computer languages, and language libraries.

   Java supports I/O through its classic I/O, NIO, and NIO.2 API categories.
   =from Jian= Historical reason!

   - Classic I/O
     provides APIs to
     + *access* the /file system/,

     + *access* _file content randomly (as opposed to sequentially)_,

     + *stream* /byte-oriented data/ BETWEEN _sources_ AND _destinations_, and
       support /character streams/.

   - NIO
     provides APIs to
     + *manage* /buffers/

     + *communicate* _buffered data_ over /channels/,

     + *leverage* _readiness selection_ via /selectors/

     + *scan* _textual data_ quickly via /regular expressions/

     + *specify* _character encodings_ via /charsets/

     + *support* _printf-style formatting_.

   - NIO.2
     provides APIs to
     + *improve* the /file system interface/;

     + *support* /asynchronous I\slash{}O/;

     + *complete* /socket channel/ _functionality_ by upgrading ~DatagramChannel~,
       ~ServerSocketChannel~, and ~SocketChannel~, and by introducing a new
       ~MulticastChannel~ /interface/.

* Part II: Classic I/O APIs - 17
* TODO Chapter 2: ~File~ - 19
  - Applications often _interact_ with a /file system/, which is usually implemented
    as a hierarchy of files and directories starting from a root directory.

    OS's on which a JVM runs typically support *at least ONE* /file system/.
    For example,
    + _Unix/Linux_ combines all _mounted (attached and prepared) disks_ into one 
      /virtual file system/.

    + In contrast,
      _Windows_ associates a separate file system with each active disk drive.

  - Java offers access to the underlying OS's available file system(s) via its
    concrete ~java.io.File~ /class/, which this chapter explores.

       * The total number of data items that can be stored in the /buffer/.

       * It is specified when the /buffer/ is created and *cannot* be changed
         later.

     + Limit:
       The zero-based index of the first element that *should not* be read or
       written. In other words, *it identifies the number of “live” data items in
       the buffer.*

     + Position:
       The zero-based index of the next data item that can be read or the location
       where the data item can be written.

     + Mark:
       A zero-based index to which the /buffer's position/ will be *reset* when
       the buffer's ~reset()~ /method/ (presented shortly) is called.
       *The mark is initially undefined.*

        The ByteOrder value returned from order() can take on a different value
        based on how the buffer was created. If a multibyte buffer (such as a
        floating-point buffer) was created by allocation or by wrapping an existing
        array, the buffer’s byte order is the native order of the underlying operating
        system.

    - A /view buffer/ keep the /byte order/ setting when it is created.
      It cannot be subsequently changed.

      =from Jian=
      This means the underlying if the /buffer/ change /its byte order/, the
      /view buffer/ will have ill-behaviors

    - ~ByteBuffer~ is by default always /big endian/, no matter the way the OS
      uses.
        This is because *Java's default byte order is also /big endian/,* which
      lets /classfiles/ and /serialized objects/ store data consistently across
      JVM.

    - You can change the /byte order/ of ~ByteBuffer~ through the ~order(ByteOrder bo)~
      /method/.
        We use this /method/ because /big endian/ setting can impact performance
      on /little endian/ OS.

  /Channels/ *partner with* /buffers/ to achieve *high-performance I/O*.

** TODO Introducing Channels - 149
   - /Channel/ :: an object that represents an open connection
                  to a hardware device, a file, a network socket, an application
                  component, or another entity that's capable of performing
                  writes, reads, and other I/O operations.

   - /Channels/ efficiently *transfer* data between /byte buffers/ and /OS-based
     I/O service sources or destinations/.

   - *Note*
     + /Channels/ *are* gateways through which I/O services are accessed.

     + /Channels/ *use* /byte buffers/ as the endpoints for sending and receiving
       data.

   - There often exists a *one-to-one correspondence*
     BETWEEN
     an /OS file handle/ or /file descriptor/ =from Jian= these two concepts??? =TODO=
     AND
     a /channel/.

     When you work with /channels/ in a file context, the /channel/ will often
     be connected to an /open file descriptor/.
       Despite /channels/ being _more abstract_ than /file descriptors/, they
     are still capable of modeling an operating system’s I/O facilities.

** DONE Channel and Its Children - 149 - =Re-READ=
   CLOSED: [2018-10-12 Fri 16:56]
   - Java supports /channels/ via its ~java.nio.channels~ and ~java.nio.channels.spi~
     /packages/.
     + Applications interact with the types located in the _former_ package;

     + developers who are defining *new* /selector providers/ work with the _latter_
       package. (I will discuss selectors in the next chapter.)
       =TODO= =???=

   - All /channels/ implement the ~java.nio.channels.Channel~ /interface/.
     It declares the following /methods/:
     + ~void close()~
       * Close a *already closed* /channel/ has *NO* effect.

       * This /method/ can throw ~java.io.IOException~
         when and I/O error occurs.

       * This /method/ can throw ~java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException~
         when invoke operations on a *CLOSED* /channel/.

     + ~boolean isOpen()~

   - To support I/O, ~Channel~ is _extended by_
     + The ~java.io.channels.WritableByteChannel~ /interface/
       * It declares ~abstract int write(ByteBuffer buffer)~
         - *Core Action* (side effect)
           write a sequence of bytes _from_ /buffer/ _to_ the CURRENT /channel/.

         - *Return value*
           the _number of bytes_ *ACTUALLY* written.

       * It throws
         - ~java.nio.channels.NonWritableChannelException~
           when the /channel/ was *NOT opened for writing*,

         - ~java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException~
           when the /channel/ is *closed*,

         - ~java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException~
           when _ANOTHER thread_ *closes* the /channel/ *during* the write,

         - ~java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptException~
           when _ANOTHER thread_ *interrupts* the _CURRENT thread_ while the
           write operation is in progress (thereby closing the /channel/ and
           setting the current thread's /interrupt status/ =???= =TODO=),
           =TODO= =???=

         - ~IOException~
           when some other I/O error occurs.

     + The ~java.io.channels.ReadableByteChannel~ /interface/
       * It declares ~abstract int read(ByteBuffer buffer)~
         - *Core Action* (side effect)
           read bytes _from_ the CURRENT /channel/ _into_ /buffer/.

         - *Return value* 
           the _number of bytes_ *ACTUALLY* read (or -1 when there are no more
           bytes to read).

       * It throws
         - ~java.nio.channels.NonReadableChannelException~
           when the channel was not opened for reading;

         - ~ClosedChannelException~
           when the channel is closed;

         - ~AsynchronousCloseException~
           when another thread closes the channel during the read;

         - ~ClosedByInterruptException~
           when another thread interrupts the current thread while the write
           operation is in progress, thereby closing the channel and setting the
           current thread’s /interrupt status/;

         - ~IOException~
           when some other I/O error occurs.

   - *Note*
     + ~WritableByteChannel~ and ~ReadableByteChannel~ are *UNIdirectional*.

     + You can use ~instanceof~ to test if a /channel/ is ~WritableByteChannel~
       or ~ReadableByteChannel~.

     + If some of your /channel/ implement _BOTH_, you can test with
       ~instanceof ByteChannel~, which is a marker interface that *subtypes* 
       ~WritableByteChannel~ and ~ReadableByteChannel~

   - The ~java.nio.channels.InterruptibleChannel~ /interface/ (a sub-interface of
     ~Channel~):
       ~InterruptibleChannel~ describes a channel that _can be_ *asynchronously
     closed and interrupted*.
       It *overrides* its ~Channel~ /superinterface/'s ~close()~ /method/ header,
     presenting the following additional stipulation to ~Channel~'s contract for
     this method: Any /thread/ currently /blocked/ in an I/O operation on this
     /channel/ will receive ~AsynchronousCloseException~ (an ~IOException~
     descendent). =TODO= =???= =???=

     A /channel/ that implements this /interface/ is
     + *asynchronously closeable*:
       When a /thread/ is /BLOCKED/ in an I/O operation on an /interruptible
       channel/, ANOTHER /thread/ may invoke the /channel/'s ~close()~ /method/.
       This causes the _blocked_ /thread/ to receive a thrown
       ~AsynchronousCloseException~ instance. =TODO=

     + *interruptible*:
       When a /thread/ is /BLOCKED/ in an I/O operation on an /interruptible
       channel/, ANOTHER /thread/ may invoke the /BLOCKED/ /thread/'s
       ~interrupt()~ method.
         Doing this causes the /channel/ to be closed, the /blocked thread/ to
       receive a thrown ~ClosedByInterruptException~ instance, and the /blocked
       thread/ to have its /interrupt status/ set. (When a thread’s interrupt
       status is already set and it invokes a blocking I/O operation on a
       channel, the channel is closed and the thread will immediately receive a
       thrown ~ClosedByInterruptException~ instance; its /interrupt status/ will
       remain set.)
       =TODO=

     + NIO's designers chose to shut down a /channel/ when a /blocked thread/ is
       interrupted because they couldn't find a way to reliably handle interrupted
       I/O operations in the same manner across operating systems.

       The *only* way to guarantee _deterministic behavior_ was to shut down the
       channel.
       =TODO=

   - *Tip*
     You can determine WHETHER OR NOT a /channel/ SUPPORTS /asynchronous closing
     and interruption/ by using the ~instanceof~ operator in an expression such
     as ~channel instanceof InterruptibleChannel~.

   - /Channels/ have are *two* ways to obtain a /channel/:
     + The ~java.nio.channels~ package provides a ~Channel~'s /utility class/
       that offers *two* /methods/ for _obtaining /channels/ from /streams/._

       For each of the following /methods/, *the underlying /stream/ is closed
       when the /channel/ is closed,* and the /channel/ is *NOT buffered*:

       * ~WritableByteChannel newChannel(OutputStream outputStream)~
         for the given ~outputStream~.

       * ~ReadableByteChannel newChannel(InputStream inputStream)~
         for the given ~inputStream~.

     + Various classic I/O classes have been retrofitted to support _channel
       creation_.
       For example,
       * ~java.io.RandomAccessFile~ declares a ~FileChannel getChannel()~;
       * ~java.net.Socket~ declares a ~SocketChannel getChannel()~.

   - A /selector/ is an object created from a /subclass/ of the ~abstract Selector class~.

   - The /selector/ *maintains a set of channels* that it examines to determine
     which /channels/ are *READY FOR*
     + _reading_
     + _writing_
     + _completing a connection sequence_
     + _accepting another connection_
     + _SOME combination of these tasks_.

   - /Selectors/ are used with /selectable channels/, which are objects whose
     classes ultimately inherit from the ~abstract SelectableChannel class~,
     which describes a /channel/ that can be *multiplexed* by a /selector/.

   - One or more previously created /selectable channels/ are _REGISTERED WITH_ a
     /selector/.
       Each _registration_ returns an /instance/ of a /subclass/ of the ~abstract
     SelectionKey class~, which is a token signifying the _relationship BETWEEN
     one /channel/ and the /selector/._

     When a /selection method/ is invoked, the /selector's associated keys/ are
     updated by checking all /channels/ registered with that /selector/.

     The application can then obtain a set of keys whose /channels/ were found
     ready and iterate over these keys to service each /channel/ that has become
     ready since the previous select method call.
