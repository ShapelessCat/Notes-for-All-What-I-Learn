* 1 Introduction - 1
  - THIS book is designed to help you make the most effective use of
    + the Java™ programming language

    + its fundamental libraries:
      * ~java.lang~, ~java.util~, and ~java.io~
      * subpackages such as ~java.util.concurrent~ and ~java.util.function~

  - Book structure:
    + 90 /items/, each of which conveys one rule.
    + /items/ are lossely grouped into 11 /chapters/ -- each describes one broad
      aspect of software design.

  - The book is *NOT* intended to be read from cover to cover:
    each item stands on its own, more or less.

    However, they are heavily cross-referenced.

  - This book is *NOT* for beginners.

  - This table shows you where to go for primary coverage of key features:

* 2 Creating and Destroying Objects - 5
  THIS chapter concerns creating and destroying objects:
  + when and how to *create* them;
  + when and how to *avoid creating* them;
  + how to ensure they are *destroyed in a timely manner*;
  + how to manage any cleanup actions that *must precede* their destruction.

** DONE Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors - 5
   CLOSED: [2018-01-31 Wed 14:18]
   - To obtain an instance of a class, besides the traditional way of using
     /public constructor/, you can
     _Use a public static factory method_.
     Example,
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       // The boxed primitive class of `boolean`
       public static Boolean valueOf(boolean b)
       {
           return b ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
       }
     #+END_SRC

   - NOTE:
     /static factory method/ is *NOT* the /Factory Method pattern/ for Design
     Patterns [Gamma95].

   - Providing a /static factory method/ *instead* of a /public constructor/ has
     both _advantages_ and _disadvantages_.
     + *ADVANTAGES*
       * One advantage :: /static factory methods/ is that, _UNLIKE_ /construc-
                          tors/, *they have names*.

         - =Comment from Jian=
           + Of course, you can say a /constructor/ has its name, in the sense that
             you can identify a /constructor/ in the body of a /class/ by finding
             something has the same "name" as this /class/.

           + However, this is not a a real "name":
             * You CANNOT pick *ANY* name you want for a /constructor/ -- it must
               be the same as its /class name/, which is more like a kind of id for
               a group of things, rather than for a specific thing.

             * This "name" doesn't have enough information that can help the
               programmer. If we can, we prefer a more informative name.

         - A /static factory/ with a _well-chosen name_ is
           1. easier to use
           2. and the resulting client code easier to read

         - Example:
           This is a /constructor/ in ~BigInteger~, which *should never be used*
           since Java 4: ~BigInteger(int bitLength, int certainty, Random rnd)~,
           which is documented as =Constructs a randomly generated positive
           BigInteger that is probably prime, with the specified bitLength.=

           You CANNOT get the information in this document from the name of the
           /constructor/ -- the name ~BigInteger~, even with its type signature,
           includes no info about _probably prime_!

           The RIGHT choice since Java 4 is a /static factory method/ named
           ~BigInteger.probablePrime(int bitLength, Random rnd)~, which is
           documented as =Returns a positive BigInteger that is probably prime,
           with the specified bitLength.=

         - A class can have ONLY a *SINGLE* /constructor/ _with a given
           signature_.

           Programmers have been known to get around this restriction by
           providing two constructors whose parameter lists _differ only in the
           order_ of their parameter types.
           *This is a really _BAD idea_.*

           It is not reasonable that you can expect the user can REMEMBER all the
           details, especially something like this kind -- the order of different
           type parameters.

           =Comment From Jian=
           A good API should NOT force the API users to REMEMBER too much thing.
           The designer should choose good names for the API, which is an
           important part of API design, and save useful info inside names.

           Because they have names, /static factory methods/ do *NOT* share the
           restriction of /constructors/.

           =Conclusion=
           In cases where a /class/ seems to require *MULTIPLE* /constructors/
           with the same signature
           1. replace the /constructors/ with /static factory methods/
           2. carefully chosen names to highlight their differences.

       * A second advantage :: UNLIKE /constructors/, /static factory methods/
            are *NOT* required to create a new object each time they're invoked.

         - This allows /immutable classes/ (Item 17) =TODO= to use preconstructed
           instances, or to cache instances as they're constructed, and dispense
           them repeatedly to _avoid_ creating unnecessary duplicate objects.

           =TODO= This technique is similar to the /Flyweight pattern [Gamma95]/

         - The ability of static factory methods to return the same object from
           repeated invocations allows classes to maintain strict control over
           what instances exist at any time.

           Classes that do this are said to be /instance-controlled/.

           There are several reasons to write instance-controlled classes.
           + Instance control allows a class to GUARANTEE that it is a /singleton/
             (Item 3) =TODO= or /noninstantiable/ (Item 4) =TODO=.

           + Also, it allows an immutable value class (Item 17) =TODO= to make the
             GUARANTEE that *NO two equal instances exist*: ~a.equals(b)~ iff ~a
             \equal{}\equal{} b~. This is the basis of the /Flyweight pattern [Gamma95]/ =TODO=.
             ~Enum~ types (Item 34) =TODO= provide this guarantee.

       * A third advantage :: UNLIKE /constructors/, /static factory methods/ can
            return an object of *ANY SUBTYPE* of their return type.

            This gives you great flexibility in choosing the class of the
            returned object.

         - /interface-based frameworks/ (Item 20)
           =TODO=
           =TODO=

         - Prior to Java 8, interfaces couldn’t have static methods.
           By convention, use /noninstantiable companion class/ (Item 4) =TODO=

         - For Java 8 or later:
           + Java 8 /interfaces/ can have ~public static~ /method/.

           + Java 9 /interfaces/ can have both ~public static~ /method/ and
             ~private static~ /method/.

           + There are still restrictions about /inteface/ ~static~ /members/ for
             Java 9: ~static~ /fields/ and ~static class~'s still *MUST be*
             ~public~.


       * A fourth advantage :: the /class/ of the returned object can *VARY* from
            call to call as a function of the input parameters.

         - Any /subtype/ of the _declared return type_ is PERMISSIBLE. The
           /class/ of the returned object can also *VARY from release to release*.

         - Example:
           The ~EnumSet~ /class/ (Item 36 =TODO=) has *NO* /public constructors/,
           *ONLY* /static factories/.

           + *In the OpenJDK (NOT the Oracle JDK)* (=From Jian= which version?),
             they return an instance of one of _TWO_ /subclasses/
             * ~RegularEnumSet~ for the sets contain <= 64 elements, which is
               backed by a single ~long~.

             * ~JumboEnumSet~ for the sets contain > 64 elements, which is backed
               by a ~long~ array.

           + This implementation can evolve:
             * If ~RegularEnumSet~ ceased to offer performance advantages for
               small enum types, it could be eliminated from a future release
               _with NO ill effects_.

             * If more /subclasses/ are required for performance, they can be
               added _with NO ill effects_

             Both cases clients neither know nor care about the class of the
             object they get back from the factory; they care only that it is
             some /subclass/ of ~EnumSet~.

       * A fifth advantage :: the /class/ of the returned object need not exist
            when the class containing the method is written.
         =TODO=
         =Comment from Jian= As I understand (the paragraphes in the book is NOT
            straightforward): Since the returned type of a /static factories/ is
            usually an /interface/, the returned types of runtime can be any
            implementation of this /interface/ or /sub-interfaces/
         =TODO=

       * *DISADVANTAGES*
         * The main limitation :: /classes/ without ~public~ or ~protected~
              /constructors/ CANNOT be subclassed.

           + For example, it is impossible to subclass any of the convenience
             implementation classes in the Collections Framework.

             *ARGUABLY* this can be a blessing in disguise
             BECAUSE
             - it encourages programmers to use composition instead of inheritance (Item 18), =TODO=
             - it is required for immutable types (Item 17) =TODO=.

         * A second shortcoming :: they are hard for programmers to find.

           + They are not like /constructors/ which have a separate section in
             Javadoc, and, even without this help, they can be found by searching
             the /class/ name.

           + The Javadoc tool may someday draw attention to /static factory
             methods/, but it haven't.

           What you can do is:
           1. Many /static factories/ are located in /noninstantiable companion
              classes/.

           2. Pay attention to /interface static methods/, they might be (=TODO=
              =???= mostly always be) /static factories/.

           3. Pay attention to /static members/ to find out the /static
              factories/.

           4. Adhere to *common naming conventions*.
              Here is a far from exhaustive list:
              - ~from~
                A *type-conversion* method that takes a single parameter and
                returns a corresponding instance of this type, for example:
                ~Date d = Date.from(instant);~

              - ~of~
                An *aggregation* method that takes multiple parameters and
                returns an instance of this type that incorporates them, for
                example:
                ~Set<Rank> faceCards = EnumSet.of(JACK, QUEEN, KING);~

              - ~valueOf~
                A more verbose alternative to ~from~ and ~of~ (for boxed types,
                ~valueOf~ is used to replace something like ~new Integer(3)~,
                which is DEPRECATED), for example:
                ~BigInteger prime = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE);~

              - ~instance~ or ~getInstance~ =TODO= =???=
                Returns an instance that is described by its parameters (if any)
                but cannot be said to have the same value, for example:
                ~StackWalker luke = StackWalker.getInstance(options);~

              - ~create~ or ~newInstance~
                LIKE ~instance~ or ~getInstance~, except that the method
                *guarantees that each call returns a new instance*, for example:
                ~Object newArray = Array.newInstance(classObject, arrayLen);~

              - ~get<Type>~ =TODO= =???=
                LIKE ~getInstance~, but used if the factory method is in a
                different class. Type is the type of object returned by the
                factory method, for example:
                ~FileStore fs = Files.getFileStore(path);~

              - ~new<Type>~
                LIKE ~newInstance~, but used if the factory method is in a
                different class. Type is the type of object returned by the
                factory method, for example:
                ~BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path);~

              - ~<type>~
                A concise alternative to ~getType~ and ~newType~, for example:
                ~List<Complaint> litany = Collections.list(legacyLitany);~

   - *SUMMARY*
     + Often /static factories/ are *PREFERABLE*!

       Avoid the reflex to provide /public constructors/ without first
       considering /static factories/.

** TODO Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters - 11
   - /Static factories/ and /constructors/ share a *LIMITATION*:
     *they do not scale well to large numbers of optional parameters*.

   - Use an example to illustrate -- *Nutrition Facts label object*
     It has REQUIRED fields and OPTIONAL fields, and the total number of fields
     is very large. We must consider the /scalability/ for constructing.

   - TWO defective ways:
     + /telescoping constructor/ pattern
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         // Telescoping constructor pattern - does not scale well!
         public class NutritionFacts {
             private final int servingSize; // (mL) required
             private final int servings; // (per container) required
             private final int calories; // (per serving) optional
             private final int fat; // (g/serving) optional
             private final int sodium; // (mg/serving) optional
             private final int carbohydrate; // (g/serving) optional

             public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings)
             {
                 this(servingSize, servings, 0);
             }

             public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings, int calories)
             {
                 this(servingSize, servings, calories, 0);
             }

             public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings, int calories, int fat)
             {
                 this(servingSize, servings, calories, fat, 0);
             }

             public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings, int calories, int fat,
                                   int sodium)
             {
                 this(servingSize, servings, calories, fat, sodium, 0);
             }

             public NutritionFacts(int servingSize, int servings, int calories, int fat,
                                   int sodium, int carbohydrate)
             {
                 this.servingSize = servingSize;
                 this.servings = servings;
                 this.calories = calories;
                 this.fat = fat;
                 this.sodium = sodium;
                 this.carbohydrate = carbohydrate;
             }
         }

         // Somewhere in a class -- Construction
         NutritionFacts cocaCola = new NutritionFacts(240, 8, 100, 0, 35, 27);
       #+END_SRC

       * *Limitations*:
         Typically even the shortest /constructor/ that can fullfill your
         requirement includes many parameters that you do NOT want to set, but
         you're forced to pass a value for them anyway (even if a default
         setting is already there). In this case, it is the ~0~ for ~fat~.

       * In short,
         the /telescoping constructor/ pattern works, but
         + it is HARD to _write client code_ when there are many parameters

         + it is HARDER still to _read_ it
           If you accidentally reverses two such parameters, the compiler CANNOT
           help you to identify the bug.

     + JavaBeans pattern
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         // JavaBeans Pattern - allows inconsistency, mandates mutability
         public class NutritionFacts {
             // Parameters initialized to default values (if any)
             private int servingSize = -1; // Required; no default value
             private int servings = -1;    // Required; no default value
             private int calories = 0;
             private int fat = 0;
             private int sodium = 0;
             private int carbohydrate = 0;

             // TODO (From Jian): I don't think we need this constructor for the
             //      reason that if there is no constructor defined, Java will
             //      help to create a DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR as this one.

  - Although ~Object~ is a /concrete class/, _it is designed primarily for extension_.
    All of its nonfinal methods (~equals~, ~hashCode~, ~toString~, ~clone~, and
    ~finalize~) have explicit general /contracts/ because they are designed to be
    overridden.

    + *It is the responsibility of any class overriding these methods to obey their

        failure to do so will prevent other classes that depend on the contracts

* 6 Enums and Annotations - 157
  This chapter discusses best practices of using two special-purpose families of
  /reference types/:
  - /enum type/, a kind of /class/
  - /annotation type/, a kind of /interface/

** Item 34: Use enums instead of ~int~ constants - 157
   - _BEFORE_ introducing /enums/, the common pattern of defining enumeration values
     was to declare a group of named ~int~ constants, one for each member of the
     type:
     #+begin_src java
       // The int enum pattern - severely deficient!
       public static final int APPLE_FUJI         = 0;
       public static final int APPLE_PIPPIN       = 1;
       public static final int APPLE_GRANNY_SMITH = 2;

       public static final int ORANGE_NAVEL = 0;
       public static final int ORANGE_TEMPLE = 1;
       public static final int ORANGE_BLOOD = 2;
     #+end_src
     + Shortcomings:
       + NO type safety
         Example:
         You can by accident do
         #+begin_src java
           // Tasty citrus flavored applesauce!
           int i = (APPLE_FUJI - ORANGE_TEMPLE) / APPLE_PIPPIN;
         #+end_src
         Calculation between different groups of enums are usually meaningless.
         It is mostly a typo.

       + Less expressive power

     + Wrong hot unplug/plug
       Programs that use /int enums/ are _brittle_.
       Because /int enums/ are /constant variables/ [JLS, 4.12.4], their int
       values are compiled into the clients that use them [JLS, 13.1].
         If the value associated with an int enum is changed, its clients *MUST
       be recompiled*. If not, the clients will still run, but their behavior
       will be incorrect.

* TODO 10 Exceptions - 293
** DONE Item 69: Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions - 293 - TODO =RE-READ=
   CLOSED: [2020-01-08 Wed 02:07]
   #+begin_quote
   Exceptions are, as their name implies, to be used only for exceptional
   conditions; they should never be used for ordinary control flow.
   #+end_quote
   =from Jian= Right for Java, but may not always right in other languages
   (Python, etc).

   An example that is a horrible abuse of exceptions. *Don't ever do this!*
   #+begin_src java
     try {
         int i = 0;
         while(true)
             range[i++].climb();
     } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
     }
   #+end_src

   - The code doesn't have an obvious meaning.
     TODO See Item 67

   - It use an /exception/ to stop a loop.
     This can be done with a more readible and efficient way:
     #+begin_src java
       for (Mountain m : range)
           m.climb();
     #+end_src

   - People who write the expcetion-based idioms may have some guesses like:
     TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO
     However, there are three things wrong with this reasoning:
     + Because exceptions are designed for exceptional circumstances, there is
       _little incentive_ for JVM implementors to _make them as fast as_
       explicit tests.

     + Placing code inside a try-catch block _inhibits certain optimizations_ that
       JVM implementations might otherwise perform.

     + The standard idiom for looping through an array doesn't necessarily result
       in redundant checks. _Many JVM implementations optimize them away_.

   - Author provide a concrete example.
     Loop a 100 elements array and the _exception-based idiom_ is about
     _twice as slow_ as the _standard one_.

   - Other reasons:
     + They ~try~ block may inlucde some other code can generate /excpetions/ the
       ~catch~ block will catch -- it can guarantee the catched one is the one and
       the expected functionality (in the ~try~ block) is done.
         Worsely, even exceptions happen, the user may think the expceted work is
       done -- if the exception throwed be catched (i.e. match the given) try
       blocked executed, expected exceptions are triggered and catched. The
       whole ~try .. catch~ block is finished.

   - *Principle for API design*
     _A well-designed API must not force its clients to use /excpetions/ for ordinary
     control flow._

   - A class with a /"state-dependent" method/ that can be invoked only under certain
     unpredictable conditions should generally have a separate /"state-testing"
     method/ indicating whether it is appropriate to invoke the /state-dependent
     method/. For example,
     + ~Iterator~ interface.
       * _WITHOUT_ the /"state-testing" method/ ~hasNext~:
         #+begin_src java
           // Do not use this hideous code for iteration over a collection!
           try {
               Iterator<Foo> i = collection.iterator();
               while(true) {
                   Foo foo = i.next();
                   // ...
               }
           } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
           }
         #+end_src

       * _WITH_ the /"state-testing" method/ ~hasNext~:
         the foreach loop syntatic sugar):
         #+begin_src java
           for (Iterator<Foo> i = collection.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
               Foo foo = i.next();
               // ...
           }
         #+end_src

     + An alternative to providing a separate /state-testing method/ is to have
       the /state dependent method/ return an /empty optional/ (Item 55) or a
       _distinguished value_ such as ~null~ if it cannot perform the desired
       computation.
       * Q :: How to choose a proper one in different situations?
       * A ::
         - Situation 1:
           If an object is to be accessed _concurrently_ _WITHOUT external
           synchronization_ or _is subject to externally induced state
           trasitions_,
           *you MUST use the ~optional~ or _distinguished return value_ way.*
           /state-testing method/ can't promise that after its checking and
           before/during the /state dependent operation/, no critical data
           changed by other threads.

         - Other situations: =RE-READ= =RE-NOTE=
           Both ways are applicable, and the /state testing method/ is mildly
           preferable, with which errors may be easier to detect: just let
           the /state dependent method/ throw an exception when people forget to
           call the /state testing method/ first.

   - Summary
     + Exceptions are designed for exceptional conditions.

     + Don't use them for ordinary control flow, and don't write APIs that force
       others to do so.
