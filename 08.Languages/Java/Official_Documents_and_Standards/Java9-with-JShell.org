* 1. JShell – A Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop for Java 9
  We will do the following:
  - *Check* /default imports/ and
    *use* /auto-complete features/

  - *Run* Java 9 code in JShell

  - *Evaluate* expressions

  - *Work with* variables, methods, and sources

  - *Edit* the source code in our favorite external code editor

  - *Load* source code
