* 1 Introduction to JShell
  - For _reference information_ for this tool, see jshell in _Java Platform, Standard Edition
    Tools Reference_.

** Why Use JShell? - 1-1
   - xx

** Starting and Stopping JShell - 1-1
   - In this manual we will use the /verbose mode/ of /JShell/.

     Start the /JShell/ with the command ~jshell -v~, and then you can get the
     maximum amount of feedback available.

     This mode is especially helpful if you are not familier with /JShell/.

* DONE 2 Snippets
  CLOSED: [2018-07-27 Fri 16:14]
  - /JShell/ accepts
    + Java statements;
    + variable, method, and class definitions;
    + imports; and
    + expressions.

    These pieces of Java code are referred to as /snippets/.

** DONE Trying Out Snippets - 2-1
   CLOSED: [2018-07-27 Fri 13:09]
   - *Note*:
     Terminating _semicolons_ are *automatically added* to the end of a complete
     snippet if not entered.

   - When an expression is entered that is NOT assigned to a variable,
     a /scratch variable/ is created so that the value _can be referenced later_.
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       // jshell> 2 + 2
       // $3 ==> 4
       // |  created scratch variable $3 : int

       // jshell> $3
       // $3 ==> 4
       // |  value of $3: int
     #+END_SRC

   - The /continuation prompt (=...>=)/ that is used when a /snippet/ requires
     more than one line of input to complete. For example,
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       // jshell>
       2 + 2

       // jshell> String twice(String s) {
       //    ...>    return s + s;
       //    ...> }
       //    created method twice(String)
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Changing Definitions - 2-2
   CLOSED: [2018-07-27 Fri 13:09]
   - The definition is easily changed by entering a new one, which *overwrites*
     the previous definition.

*** Changing the Level of Feedback - 2-2
    We are using the /verbose feedback mode/.
    You can use ~/set feedback~ to _change the level of feedback_.

    - ~/set feedback concise~

    - ~/set feedback silent~
      If you primarily use JShell by pasting from other windows, then you might
      prefer a feedback mode with no prompt and only error feedback.

** DONE Forward References - 2-3
   CLOSED: [2018-07-27 Fri 13:47]
   JShell accepts /forward references/.

   However, it will warn you, and tell you what you should do before invoking
   these kind of functions.

   - Example:
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     jshell> double volume(double radius) {
        ...> return 4.0 / 3.0 * PI * cube(radius);
        ...> }
     |  created method volume(double), however, it cannot be invoked until variable PI,
     and method cube(double) are declared
     #+END_QUOTE

     Then, you can do

     #+BEGIN_SRC java
     double PI = 3.1415926535
     // PI ==> 3.1415926535
     // |  created variable PI : double 

     volume(2)
     // | attempted to call method volume(double) which cannot be invoked until method
     // cube(double) is declared
     
     double cube(double x) { return x * x * x; }
     // |  created method cube(double)
     // |    update modified method volume(double)
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Exceptions - 2-4
   CLOSED: [2018-07-27 Fri 14:21]
   There is *NO* _absolute line number_ in JShell.

   - Q :: Then how does JShell mark the line location in an /exception
          backtrace/?

   - A :: JShell use the form of =#ID:line-number=, where snippet ID is the number
          displayed by the ~/list~ command, and line-number is the line number
          within the snippet.

   - Example
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     jshell> int divide(int x, int y) {
        ...> return x / y;
        ...> }
     |  created method divide(int,int)

     jshell> divide(5, 0)
     |  java.lang.ArithmeticException thrown: /by zero
     |        at divide (#1:2)
     |        at (#2:1)

     jshell> /list
        1 : int divide(int x, int y) {
                return x / y;
            }

        2 : divide(5, 0)
     #+END_QUOTE

   1. Tab to complete the name or list candidate names.

   2. Tab again to list the parameter(s) info if there
      is/are parameter(s).

   3. Tab again to show the document of this /method/.

** DONE Snippet Transformation - 2-5
   CLOSED: [2018-07-27 Fri 16:14]
   - In JShell, when you use a class that you _haven't imported_, you can use
     =<Shift+Tab i>= to trigger a query, which can be used to help you import the
     class.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     jshell> new JFrame<Shift+Tab i>
     0: Do nothing
     1: import: javax.swing.JFrame
     Choice: 1
     Imported: javax.swing.JFrame

     jshell> new JFrame
     #+END_QUOTE

   - Convert an expression to a variable declaration by pressing =<Shift+Tab v>=
     after enter the expression.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     jshell> new JFrame("Demo") <Shift+Tab v>
     jshell> JFrame | = new JFrame("Demo")
     #+END_QUOTE

     Here =|= is the cursor, and you can enter a variable name there.

     + For the result type that you did't import:
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       jshell> frame.getGraphics() <Shift+Tab v>
       0: Do nothing
       1: Create variable
       2: import: java.awt.Graphics. Create variable
       Choice: 2
       Imported: java.awt.Graphics

       jshell> Graphics | = frame.getGraphics()

     + JShell has a _default startup script_ that is silently and automatically
       executed before JShell starts, so that you can get to work quickly.
         Entries from the startup script are *NOT* listed unless you request
       them with the ~/list -start~ or ~/list -all~ command:
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       jshell> /list -all
         s1 : import java.util.*;
         s2 : import java.io.*;
         s3 : import java.math.*;

          2 : int x = 45;
          3 : 2 + 2
          4 : String twice(String s) {
                return s + s;
              }
          5 : twice("Ocean")
       #+END_QUOTE

   - You can personalize the startup settings with the ~/set start~
     command. Use the command ~/help /set start~.

     ~/save -start~ saves the current startup script as a starting point for
     your own startup script.

   - ~/exit~

   - If you don’t specify an editor, then the following /environment variables/
     are checked in order: ~JSHELLEDITOR~, ~VISUAL~, and ~EDITOR~.

     If none of those are set, then a simple default editor is used.

   - To set up JShell to open the editor of your choice, use the 
     ~/set editor~ command.

     + For example, ~/set editor /usr/bin/vim~

   - feedback mode :: the prompts and feedback that are used in your interaction
                      with JShell.

   - /Predefined modes/ are provided for your convenience.
     _You can create /custom modes/ as needed._

   - The /predefined modes/ *CANNOT* be modified, but they can be used as the BASE
     of a /custom mode/.

   - The /predefined modes/, in *descending order of verbosity* are ~verbose~,
     ~normal~, ~concise~, and ~silent~.

   - The following table shows the differences in the predefined modes.

     |-----------+----------------+-------------+---------+----------+-----------|

     * _Mode_
       indicates the /mode/ that is being described.

     * _Value Snippets_
       indicates what is shown for snippets that have values, such as
       expressions, assignments, and variable declarations.

     * _Declaration_
       indicates if feedback is provided for declarations or methods, classes,
       enum, interfaces, and annotation interfaces.

     * _Updates_
       indicates if changes to other than the current snippet are shown.

     * _Commands_
       indicates if commands give feedback indicating success.

     * _Prompt_
       indicates the prompt that is used.

   - The /default feedback mode/ is ~normal~.

   - Use commands like ~/set feedback verbose~ to set the /feedback mode/.

   - Use the command ~/set feedback~ to see the current /feedback mode/ and the
     choices.

** TODO Defining a Feedback Mode - 6-2
   - *Custom* /feedback modes/ *enable* you to
     + define the prompts that you want to see

     + the feedback that you want to receive for the different elements that you
       enter into JShell.

   - A feedback mode has the following settings:
     + Prompts: Regular and continuation
     + Truncation: Maximum length of values displayed
     + Format: Format of the feedback provided

   - *The /predefined modes/ _CANNOT_ be changed*,
     but you can easily create a _copy_ of an existing mode, as shown in the
     following example:
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     jshell> /set mode mine normal -command
     |  Created new feedback mode: mine
     #+END_QUOTE
     + The ~-command~ option indicates that you want _command feedback_.

       If you don't want commands to describe the action that occurred, then use
       ~-quiet~ instead of ~-command~.

*** DONE Set Prompts
    CLOSED: [2018-07-29 Sun 03:39]
    - Check the current prompt setting:
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      jshell> /set prompt normal
      |  /set prompt normal "\njshell> " "   ...> "
      #+END_QUOTE
      + The first string is the _regular prompt_.

      + The second string is the _continuation prompt_.

      + Example:
        #+BEGIN_QUOTE
        jshell> /set prompt mine "\nmy mode: " ".......: "

        jshell> /set feedback mine
        | Feedback mode: mine

        my mode: class C {
        .......:    int x;
        .......: }
        | created class C

        my mode: 
        #+END_QUOTE

    - The prompt strings can contain ~%s~, which _is substituted with the next
      snippet ID_.

      However,
      IF a command is entered or the snippet results in an error,
      THEN the value that users enter at the prompt might not be assigned that
      ID.

    - All settings have a _DURATION_ of the _current session_;
      they are *NOT* _reset_ by the ~/reset~ command.

    - If you want to keep the settings, use the ~-retain~ option.
      For example,
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      my mode: /set mode mine -retain

      my mode: /set feedback mine -retain
      | Feedback mode: mine

      my mode: /exit
      | Goodbye

      % jshell
      | Welcome to JShell -- Version 9
      | For an introduction type: /help intro

      my mode:
      #+END_QUOTE

*** TODO Set Truncation
    - Check the current truncation setting:
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      my mode: /set truncation mine
      |  /set truncation mine 80
      |  /set truncation mine 1000 expression,varvalue
      #+END_QUOTE

*** TODO Set Formats
    - xxxx

    - xxxx

    - _To PERMANENTLY DELETE a /retained mode/,_
      use the ~-retain~ option with the ~-delete~ option:
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      my mode: /set feedback verbose -retain
      | Feedback mode: verbose

      jshell> /set mode mine -delete -retain
      #+END_QUOTE

   - TYPICALLY, the ~-retain~ option is _NOT_ used when you test a /startup script
     setting/.

     When the desired setting is found, use the ~-retain~ option to preserve it:
     ~jshell> /set start -retain~
     The startup script is then loaded the next time you start the jshell tool.

   - /Startup scripts/ can also be specified with the ~--startup~ command-line flag:
     ~% jshell --startup mystartup.jsh~

   - If you think you want use print /methods/ directly, you can
     ~jshell> /set start -retain DEFAULT PRINTING~

   - ~/set start~ without arguments is used to see the details of what is defined
     by these startup scripts.

   - To set _more than one_ startup script on the command line, use the ~--startup~
     flag for each script: ~% jshell --startup DEFAULT --startup PRINTING~
