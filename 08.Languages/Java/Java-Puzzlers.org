  - Use JDK 5.0, and talk about versions before this one.

  - Most of the puzzles exploit counterintuitive or obscure behaviors that can
    lead to bugs.

  - Source code: http:://www.javapuzzlers.com

  - Try to solve these puzzles with NO computer.

  - Most solutions contain references to relevant sections of *The Java™ Language
    Specification, Third Edition [JLS]*. These references aren't essential to
    understanding the puzzles, but they are useful if you want to delve deeper
    into the language rules underlying the puzzles.

    Similarly, many solutions contain references to relevant items in *Effective
    Java™ Programming Language Guide [EJ]*. These references are useful if you

** DONE Puzzle 1: Oddity
   Q: What does the following program print?
   CLOSED: [2017-09-23 Sat 21:49]
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     class Oddity {
         public static boolean isOdd(int i) {
             return i % 2 == 1;
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC
   - It is _WRONG_ when ~i~ is negative.
     Then it is ~-1~.

   - ~(a / b) * b + (a % b) == a~ from [JLS 15.17.3]
     When the remainder operation returns a nonzero result, it has the same sign as
     its left operand.

   - Normal solution:
     Replace the ~==~ with ~!=~
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       class Oddity {
           public static boolean isOdd(int i) {
               return i % 2 != 1;
           }
       }
     #+END_SRC

   - Efficient solution:
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       class Oddity {
           public static boolean isOdd(int i) {
               return (i & 1) != 1;
           }
       }
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Puzzle 2: Time for a Change
   Q: What does the following program print?
   CLOSED: [2017-09-23 Sat 22:28]
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class Change {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
             System.out.println(2.00 - 1.10);
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   - Poor solution:
     Replace the ~pirntln~ line with
     ~System.out.printf("%.2f%n", 2.00 - 1.10);~

   - Binary floating-point is particularly _ill-suited_ to monetary calculations.
     + Use integral types.
       ~System.out.println((200 - 100) + " cents");~
       This is not good: the input is actually 2.00 and 1.10.

     + Use ~BigDecimal~:
       When you want an exact result, always use constructor ~BigDecimal(String)~,
       rahter than ~BigDecimal(double)~. The latter one won't generate the exact
       number you want due to the inexact nature of the input type ~double~.
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         import java.match.BigDecimal;

         public class Change {
             public static void main(String args[]) {
                 System.out.println(new BigDecimal("2.00")
                                        .subtract(new BigDecimal("1.10")));
             }
         }
       #+END_SRC
       
       This solution
       * slower

       * NO pretty look

         Since Java has no liguistic support for ~BigDecimal~, we have to use
         library API to solve such a simple in nature problem through a
         non-straitforward way. Then it is resonable to get such code with a
         non-pretty look.

** DONE Puzzle 3: Long Division
   CLOSED: [2017-09-23 Sat 22:56]
   Q: What does the following program print?
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class LongDivision {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             final long MICTROS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 1000;
             final long MILLIS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
             System.out.println(MICTROS_PER_DAY / MILLIS_PER_DAY);
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   - The result ~5~ is _WRONG_.

   - Java's unitl Java SE 9 (even Scala, for this kind of cases) have no /target
     typing/.
     + target typing :: (a language feature) the type of the variable in which a
                        result is to be stored influences the type of the
                        computation.

     This means the RHS of ~=~ calculation will be calculated with using the
     default ~int~ type, even though the result will be stored into ~long~'s --
     the promotion will happen _after_ the calculation and _before_ assignment,
     which is LATE already, and then overflow happen.

   - Note:
     When working with large numbers, watch out for overflow.

     A variable is large enough to hold a result does NOT mean that the
     computation leading to the result is of the correct type (when NO
     /target typing/ feature).

     This could be done by providing support for arithmetic that does not
     overflow silently. Programs could
     + _throw an exception_ instead of overflowing, as does /Ada/.
     + _switch to a larger internal representation_ automatically as required to
       avoid overflow, as does /Lisp/.
     + use _infinite long integer_, as does /Python 3/.

     Both of these approaches may have performance penalties associated with
     them.

     =TODO=
     + Another way to reduce the likelihood of silent overflow is to support
       /target typing/, but this adds significant complexity to the type system
       [Modula-3 1.4.8].

       =From Jian= I guess this is the method /Haskell/ and /OCaml/ used.

** DONE Puzzle 4: It's Elementary
   CLOSED: [2017-09-23 Sat 23:12]
   Q: What does the following program print?
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class Elementary {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             System.out.println(12345 + 5432l);
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   + Note that the second operand is a ~long~ literal ~5423~.

   + Never use ~l~ as suffix. It is definitely a BAD design of Java.

     Use ~L~ suffix!!!!!!!!

** DONE Puzzle 5: The Joy of Hex
   CLOSED: [2017-09-23 Sat 23:38]
   Q: What does this program print?
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class JoyOfHex {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             System.out.println(
                                Long.toHexString(0x100000000L + 0xcafebabe));
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   A: It prints ~cafebabe~ rather than ~1cafebabe~

   - Solution:
     add a ~L~ suffix to ~0xcafebabe~.
   
   - Decimal literals have a nice property that is _NOT shared by hexadecimal or
     octal literals_: Decimal literals are ALL positive [JLS 3.10.1].

     _Hex and octal literals are negative if their high-order bit is set_.

   - In this program, ~0xcafebabe~ is ~-889275714~ and Java will promote this
     ~int~ literal to perform computation with the ~long~ operand ~0x100000000L~
     with /widening primitive conversion/ [JLS 5.1.2].

   - sign extension :: =TODO=

   - The calculation:
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
         0xffff_ffff_cafe_babeL
       + 0x0000_0001_0000_0000L
       -------------------------
         0x0000_0000_cafe_babeL
     #+END_SRC
     ~0x0000_0000_cafe_babeL~ is a result after truncation.
     If there is NO truncation, the result should be ~0x10000_0000_cafe_babeL~.

   - _Lesson_ of this puzzle:
     + mixed-type computations can be confusing,

       MORE so given that hex and octal literals can take on negative values
       without an explicit minus sign.

     + To avoid this sort of difficulty,
       it is generally best to _AVOID_ mixed-type computations.

   - For language designers,

     it is worth considering support for /unsigned integral types/, which
     eliminate the possibility of sign extension. One might argue that negative
     hex and octal literals should be prohibited, but this would likely
     frustrate programmers, who often use hex literals to represent values whose
     sign is of no significance.

** DONE Puzzle 6: Multicast
   CLOSED: [2017-09-23 Sat 23:54]
   Q: What does this print?
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class Multicase {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             System.out.println((int) (char) (byte) - 1);
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   A: 65535

   - /narrowing primitive conversion/ [JLS 5.1.3],

   - /Sign extension/ is performed
     if the type of the original value is signed;
     zero extension if it is a ~char~,
     regardless of the type to which it is being converted.

   - Because ~byte~ is a _signed type_, /sign extension/ occurs when converting
     the ~byte~ value –1 to a ~char~.

   - Although there is a simple rule describing the sign extension behavior of
     widening primitive conversions between signed and unsigned integral types,
     _it is best not to write programs that depend on it_.

   - Some sanarios:
     + If you are converting from a ~char~ value ~c~ to a /wider type/ and you do
       _NOT_ want /sign extension/,
       * consider using a bit mask for clarity, even though it isn't required:
         ~int i = c & 0xffff~;

       * alternatively, write a comment describing the behavior of the conversion:
         ~int i = c; // Sign extension is not performed~

     + If you are converting from a ~char~ value ~c~ to a /wider integral type/
       and you want /sign extension/:
       cast the ~char~ to a ~short~, which is the same width as a ~char~
       _but signed_.

       Given the subtlety of this code, you should also write a comment:
       ~int i = (short) c; // Cast causes sign extension~

     + If you are converting from a ~byte~ value ~b~ to a ~char~ and you do _NOT_
       want /sign extension/, you must use a bit mask to suppress it. This is a
       common idiom, so no comment is necessary:
       ~char c = (char) (b & 0xff);~

     + If you are converting from a ~byte~ to a ~char~ and you want /sign
       extension/, write a comment:
       ~char c = (char) b; // Sign extension is performed~

   - The LESSON for this puzzle:
     If you can't tell what a programdoes by looking at it, it probably doesn't
     do what you want.

     _Strive for clarity_.
     Although a simple rule describes the /sign extension/ behavior of /widening
     conversions/ involving signed and unsigned integral types, most programmers
     don't know it. If your program depends on it, make your intentions clear.

     To simplify,
     your program should NEVER depends on (for most programmers) confusing
     features without comments.

** DONE Puzzle 11: The Last Laugh
   CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 01:11]
   Q: What does the following program print?
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class LastLaugh {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
             System.out.print("H" + "a");
             System.out.print('H' + 'a');
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   A: ~Ha169~ will be printed out.
      ~'H' + 'a'~ is calculated as ~72 + 97~.

   - ~+~ is overloaded as /concatenation/ for ~String~'s.

     ~+~ is normal integral numbers /plus/ for ~char~'s (/widening primitive
     conversion/ [JLS 5.1.2, 5.6.2] will be applied automatically, the ~char~ is
     promoted to ~int~).

   - Solutions:
     #+BEGIN_SRC java

       StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
       sb.append('H');
       sb.append('a');

     #+END_SRC

   - The ~+~ operator performs string concatenation iff _at least one_ of its
     operands is of type ~String~; otherwise, it performs addition.

   - A lesson for language designers:
     /Operator overloading/, even to the limited extent that it is supported in
     Java, can be confusing.

     _It may have been a mistake to overload the ~+~ operator for ~String~'s
     concatenation_.

** DONE Puzzle 12: ABC
   CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 23:05]
   Q: What does the following program print?
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class Abc {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             String letters = "ABC";
             char[] numbers = {'1', '2', '3'};
             System.out.println(letters + " easy as " + numbers);
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC
   
   A: =ABC easy as [C@16f0472= (the hash code part changes everytime)

   - Although ~char~ is an /integral type/, many libraries treat it specially,
     because ~char~ values usually represent characters rather than integers.

     For example, passing a ~char~ value to ~println~ prints a Unicode character
     rather than its numerical code.

     + Character arrays get similar special treatment:
       The ~char[]~ overloading of ~println~ prints all of the characters
       contained in the array, and the ~char[]~ overloadings of ~String.valueOf~
       and ~StringBuffer.append~ behave analogously.

       This is why ~System.out.println(numbers)~ will do the right thing, and
       print =123= out.

     + The string concatenation operator, however, is not defined in terms of
       these methods. It performs /string conversion/ on its operands and then
       concatenate the result strings. Since ~char[]~ class only inherits the
       ~toString~ method from ~Object~ [JLS 10.7].

   - The =[C= part can be get through ~letters.getClass().getName()~.

   - Solutions:
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       // #1
       System.out.println(letters + " easy as " +
                          String.valueOf(numbers));


       // #2
       System.out.print(letters + " easy as ");
       System.out.println(numbers);
     #+END_SRC
     + The reason that ~String.valueOf~ and ~System.out.println~ can work as we
       want is we have a right type ~char[]~.

     + Invokes the wrong overloading due to an improper type.
       For example, replce the original ~numbers~ declaration line with
       ~Object numbers = new char[] { '1', '2', '3' };~

   - To summarize,
     + ~char~ arrays is NOT strings.

     + _To convert a ~char~ array to a string, invoke ~String.valueOf(char[])~._

      Some library methods do provide stringlike support for ~char~ arrays,
      typically having one overloading for ~Object~ and another for ~char[]~; only
      the latter has the desired behavior.

   - The lesson for language designers:
     the ~char[]~ type should probably have overridden ~toString~ to return the
     characters contained in the array.

     More generally, the array types should probably have overridden ~toString~
     to return a string representation of the contents of the array.

** DONE Puzzle 13: Animal Farm
   CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 23:43]
   Q: What does the following program print?
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class AnimalFarm {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             final String pig = "length: 10";
             final String dog = "length: " + pig.length();
             System.out.println("Animals are equal: "
                                + pig == dog);
         }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   A: =false=

   - In Java, ~==~ is used to compare identity.
     When compare identity, we need to consider /interned/ [JLS 15.28].

     Two constant expressions of type ~String~ represent identical object
     references. However, in the example above, ~dog~ is not initialized with a
     constant expression.

     Thus, ~pig == dog~ should be ~false~. However, this is not the real problem
     for this puzzle.

   - The actual problem of this puzzle is:
     The precedences of ~+~ (plus) and ~+~ (concatenation) are different.
     The argument of ~System.out.println~ is actually
     ~("Animal are equal: " + pig) == dog~

   - NOTE:
     + When using the string concatenation operator, always parenthesize
       nontrivial operands.

     + Never write code that depends on /interning/ of string constants.

       /interning/ is a tool used in design to reduce the memory footprint of the
       virtual machine, _NOT as a tool for programmers_.

       If you made a mistake due to /interning/, the compiler cannot help you --
       /string literal/ is also of type ~String~.

     + Use ~equals~ method.
       ~System.out.println("Animals are equal: " + pig.equals(dog));~

   - TWO lessons for language designers:
     + this implies that it is problematic to overload the ~+~ operator to
       perform string concatenation,

     + /reference equality/ is more confusing than /value equality/ for immutable
       types,

       Perhaps the ~==~ operator SHOULD perform /value comparisons/ when applied
       to immutable reference types.
         One way to achieve this would be to make the ~==~ operator a shorthand
       for the ~equals~ method, and to provide a _separate_ method to perform
       reference identity comparison, akin to ~System.identityHashCode~.

** DONE Puzzle 14: Escape Rout
   CLOSED: [2017-09-25 Mon 03:01]
   Q: What does the following program print?
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     public class EscapeRout {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             // \u0022 is the Unicode escape for double quote (")

         }
     }
   #+END_SRC

   A: =2=

   - _Java provides no special treatment for Unicode escapes within string
     literals._

     The compiler translates Unicode escapes into the characters they represent
     before it parses the program into tokens, such as string literals [JLS 3.2].

     This means the ~println~ line above can be written, and is also usually
     written as ~System.out.println("a".length() + "b".length());~

   - escape sequences ::
        For example,
     + ~\'~
     + ~\"~
     + ~\n~
     + ~\t~
     + ~\[~
     + ~\\~

   - octal escape :: =TODO=
                     NO explanation.

   - In summary,
     + prefer /escape sequences/ to /Unicode escapes/ in string and character
       literals.

     + /Unicode escapes/ can be confusing because they are processed so _EARLY_
       in the compilation sequence.

     + Do not use (or NEVER use) /Unicode escapes/ to represent ASCII characters.
       Inside of /string/ and /character literals/, use /escape sequences/;
       outside of these literals, insert ASCII characters directly into the source file.

   A: Nothing 

   - ~0x90~ (+144) is out of the range (-128 ~ 127).

   - mixed-type comparison ::
        For example, in the above example code, compare ~byte~ value with ~int~
        value.

        Note: ~0x90~ is no doubt a ~int~ value. Want to change its type? Try to

   #+END_SRC

   A: 0, which is just the value of ~j~ before this loop.

   - The origin of this problem is the ~j = j++~ line.
     This line is equivalent to:
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       int tmp = j;
       j = j + 1;
       j = tmp;
     #+END_SRC

   - The lesson here is the same as the one we learn from Puzzle 7:
     Do NOT assign to the same variable more than once in a single expression.

     An expression containing multiple assignments to the same variable is
     confusing and seldom does what you want.

   A: infinite loop, and nothing will be printed out.

   - When ~i~ equals ~END~ (~Integer.MAX_VALUE~), ~i++~ should still be

     Given the paramount importance of clarity and simplicity, it is almost

   =IMPORTANT=
   Q: Provide a declaration for ~i~ that turns this loop into an infinite loop:
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     while (i != 0)
         i >>>= 1;
   #+END_SRC

   A: Any negative number of type ~byte~ or ~short~.

   - compound assignment operator ::
     + ~*=~
     + ~/=~
     + ~%=~
     + ~+=~
     + ~-=~
     + ~<<=~
     + ~>>=~
     + ~>>>=~
     + ~&=~
     + ~^=~
     + ~|=~

   - Since ~>>>~ is an /unsigned right-shift operator/,
     if there is NO
     1. *widening* with (nigative) sign extension
     2. THEN *narrowing* 
     No infinite loop can be constructed.

     Only /unsigned right-shift operator/ cannot ever satisfy this requirement.

   - However, there is NOT ONLY /unsigned right-shift operator/.
     We have /compound assignment operator/!!!

     An _UNFORTUNATE fact_ about the /compound assignment operators/:
     they can _SILENTLY_ perform /narrowing primitive conversions/ [JLS 15.26.2],
     which are conversions from one numeric type to a less expressive numeric
     type. /Narrowing primitive conversions/ can lose information about the
     magnitude or precision of numeric values [JLS 5.1.3].

     + To make this concrete, suppose we have ~short i = -1~;
       1. Promotion
          the value of ~i~ is promoted to an ~int~.
            All arithmetic operations do this to operands of type ~short~,
          ~byte~, or ~char~. This promotion is a /widening primitive conversion/
          (with /sign extension/), so NO info is lost.

           ~(short)0xffff~  --> ~0xffffffff~

       2. Shift
          ~0xffffffff~  --> ~0x7fffffff~

       3. Finally, /narrowing primitive conversion/
          To save a ~int~ value to a ~short~ variable, do the /narrowing primitive
          conversion/.
          ~0x7fffffff~ --> ~(short)0xffff~

          _Back to where we start_

     + The above steps can be applied to and any signed narrow integral (~short~
       or ~byte~, but NOT ~char~) values, and construct a infinite loop.

   - In summary,
     _Do NOT use compound assignment operators on ~short~, ~byte~, or ~char~
     variables._
     (=From Jian= this is a general principle, though in this specific puzzle, we
      cannot use ~char~ to construct a infinite loop -- here we need /signed narrow
      primitive integral types/ and ~char~ is _unsigned_.

   - The lesson for language designers:
     languages _SHOULD NOT_ perform /narrowing conversions/ _SILENTLY_.

     One could well argue that Java should have disallowed the use of /compound
     assignment operators/ on ~short~, ~byte~, and ~char~ variables.

** DONE Puzzle 32: Curse of Looper
   CLOSED: [2017-09-28 Thu 20:19]
   Q: Provide declarations for ~i~ and ~j~ that turn this loop into an infinite
   loop:
   #+BEGIN_SRC java
     while (i <= j && j <= i && i != j) {
     }
   #+END_SRC

   A: Use boxed type.

   - The relation on the real numbers is said to be /antisymmetric/. Java's ~<=~
     operator used to be /antisymmetric/ _BEFORE_ release 5.0, _but no longer_.

   - UNTIL release 5.0, Java's /numerical comparison operators/ (~<~, ~<=~, ~>~,
     and ~>=~) required both of their operands to be of a primitive numeric type
     (~byte~, ~char~, ~short~, ~int~, ~long~, ~float~, or ~doulbe~) [JLS215.20.1]

   - In release 5.0, the specification was _CHANGED_ to say that the type of each
     operand must be _convertible_ to a primitive numeric type [JLS 15.20.1,
     5.1.8].

   - The ~<=~ operator is NOT antisymmetric on operands of these types, because
     Java's /equality operators/ (~==~ and ~!=~) perform reference indentity
     comparison rather than value comparison when applied to object references.

   - Here is one solution to the given question:
     #+BEGIN_SRC java
       Integer i = new Integer(0);
       Integer j = new Integer(0);
     #+END_SRC

     The first two subexpressions (~i <= j~ and ~j <= i~) perform /unboxing
     conversions/ [JLS 5.1.8] on ~i~ and ~j~ and compare the resulting ~int~
     values numerically.

     The third subexpression (~i != j~) performss an /identity comparison/ on the
     object references ~i~ and ~j~.

   - The reason that we have this wierd and error-prone feature is that we have
     to maintain the backward compaitability -- use ~==~ and ~!=~ to compare the
     /identity comparison/ is NOT a good design, but we cannot just change it.

   - In summary, there is a _fundamental difference_ in the way numerical
     comparison operators and equality operators behave when both operands are
     of boxed numeric types: Numerical comparison operators perform value
     comparisons, while equality operators performreference identity
     comparisons.

   - For the language designers, designers should think about how the language
     might evolve and should attempt to minimize constraints on evolution.

   - [JLS 14.20.2]
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In a ~try-finally~ statement, the ~finally~ block is always executed when
     control leaves the ~try~ block.
     #+END_QUOTE

     This is true whether the ~try~ block completes normally or _abruptly_.

     _abrupt completion_ of a statement or block occurs when:
     + it throws an exception
     + it executes a ~break~ or ~continue~ to an enclosing statement
     + it executes a ~return~ from the method (as in THIS program)

   - Discarding the reason for abrupt completion is almost never what you want,
     because the original reason for abrupt completion might be important to the
     behavior of a program.

   - In summary,
     every ~finally~ block should complete normally, barring an unchecked
     exception.

     Never exit a ~finally~ block with a ~return~, ~break~, ~continue~, or
     ~throw~, and Never allow a checked exception to propagate out of a ~finally~
     block.

   - For language designers,
     =TODO= =???= =Re-read=
     ~finally~ blocks should perhaps be required to complete normally in the
     absence of unchecked exceptions. Toward this end, a ~try-finally~ construct
     would require that the ~finally~ block can complete normally [JLS 14.21]. A
     return, break, or ~continue~ statement that transfers control out of a
     ~finally~ block would be disallowed, as would any statement that could cause
     a checked exception to propagate out of the ~finally~ block.

         [JLS 11.2.3]
         It is a compile-time error for a ~catch~ clause to catch a checked
         exception type ~E~ if the corresponding ~try~ clause can't ~throw~ an
         exception of some SUBTYPE of ~E~.


         =#2= can be compiled

         It seems that #2 is similar to #1. You many think it cannot be compiled.
         However, this is a _corner case_:
         The JLS is not terribly clear on this point,
         ~catch~ clauses that catch ~Exception~ or ~Throwable~ are legal
         regardless of the contents of the corresponding ~try~ clause.

         However, this ~try-catch~ is meaningless


         =#3= can be compiled
         The set of /checked exceptions/ that a method can throw is the
         _INTERSECTION of the sets_ of checked exceptions that it is declared to
         throw in all applicable types, NOT the UNION.

         As a result, the ~f~ method on an object whose static type is ~Type3~
         can't throw any /checked exceptions/ at all. Therefore

      - In summary,
        there is NO subtle bugs in this puzzle, but they can be a bit surprising
