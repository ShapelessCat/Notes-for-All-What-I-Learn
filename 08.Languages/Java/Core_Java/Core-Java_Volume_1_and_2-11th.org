       + Java Development Kit (JDK) :: The name describe it. It is required for any Java developer.

       + Java Runtime Environment (JRE) :: The software for consumers who want to run Java programs
         * JRE is officially published before JDK 10 TODO ???
             Since JDK 10, you don't have official JRE, but you can customize your
           project specific JRE.

       + Sever JRE :: The software for running Java programs on servers

       + Standard Edition (SE) :: The Java pla
tform for use on desktops and simple
            server applications

       + Enterprise Edition (EE) :: The Java platform for complex server applications

       + Micro Edition (ME) :: The Java platform for use on small devices

       + JavaFX :: Java GUI toolkit. It is included in Java SE prior to Java 11.

       + Java 2 (acronym: J2) :: An outdated term that described Java versions from
            1998 until 2006.
         * *CAUTION*:
           "Java 2 or J2" does not mean "Java SE 2" (there is not jargon as "Java
           SE 2" in Java 2 days, I just mock the later "Java SE 9" pattern).

       + Software Development Kit (SDK) :: The official name of the later term /JDK/
            from 1998 until 2006 (The Java 2 (J2) era).

       + Update (u) :: Oracle's term for a bug fix release up to Java 8.
         * OUTDATED since Java 9.
         * What's new??? TODO

     - History:
       1. Java version 1.2 ~ 1.4 development kit were known as the Java /SDK/.

       2. You might run into the term Java 2 that was coined in 1998 when the
          marketing folks at Sun felt that a fractional version number increment
          did not properly communicate the momentous advances of JDK 1.2.
            However, since they had that insight only after the release, they
          decided to keep the version number 1.2 for the development kit.
          Subsequent releases were numbered 1.3, 1.4, and 5.0.
            The platform, however, was renamed from Java to Java 2. Thus, we had
          Java 2 Standard Edition Software Development Kit Version 5.0, or J2SE
          SDK 5.0.
          TODO RE-ORG

       3. In 2006, the numbering was simplified.
          Since then, we have Java SE <Java Version> like Java SE 6 and Java SE 7.
          However, The "internal" version numbers are 1.6.0, 1.7.0, and 1.8.0.

       4. The minor madness of the "internal" version finally run its course with Java SE 9,
          when the version number became 9, and then 9.0.1 (TODO: semantic versioning???).
          + The version number specification requires that trailing zeroes are dropped
            for the fleeting interval between a major release and its first security update.

     - Summary:
       + Java 1.0 -> Java 1.1 -> J2SE 1.2 -> J2SE 1.3 -> J2SE 1.4 -> J2SE 5.0 -> Java SE 6 -> ...

       + TODO ??? -> Java 2 SDK 1.2 -> ... -> Java 2 SDK 1.4 -> Java 2 SDK 5.0 -> JDK 6 -> ...

*** DONE 3.3 Data Types - 42 - TODO
    CLOSED: [2019-12-17 Tue 22:50]
    - Java is a *strongly typed language*.

    - There are *8* /primitive types/.
      + 4 integer types
      + 2 double types
      + 1 char type - used for /code units/ in the Unicode encoding scheme!
      + 1 boolean type

**** DONE 3.3.1 Integer Types - 43
      CLOSED: [2019-12-15 Sun 19:04]
      - =from Jian=
        All Java integer types have /total order/.

      - Java Integer Types
        | Type    | Storage Requirement | Range (inclusive)    |
        |---------+---------------------+----------------------|
        | ~int~   | 4 bytes             | -2**31 ~ (2**31 - 1) |
        | ~short~ | 2 bytes             | -2**15 ~ (2**15 - 1) |
        | ~long~  | 8 bytes             | -2**63 ~ (2**63 - 1) |
        | ~byte~  | 1 byte              | -2**7 ~ (2**7 - 1)   |

      - Best practice of why to use one type:
        1. Use ~int~ in most situations
          =from Jian= TODO rationale

        2. When the range of the value you want to represent exceeds the range of ~int~.

        3. ~byte~ and ~short~ are mainly intended for specialized applications
           For example,
           + low-level file handling
           + for large arrays when storage space is at a premium

      - Suffix for /integer number literals/:
        ~l~ and ~L~ for ~long~

      - Prefix for /integer number literals/:
        + Hexadecimal: ~0x~ or ~0X~
          * =from Jian= You may like ~0x~, because we usually use hexadecimal number
            representation with _capital letters_!
            For instance, ~0xCAFE~ is more readible than ~0XCAFE~!!!

        + Octal: ~0~

        + Binary (since Java SE 7): ~0b~ or ~0B~

      - Since Java SE 7:
        You can insert underscores to any position in number literals to improve readibility!
        For instance, ~1_000_000~ or ~1_000000~.

**** DONE 3.3.2 Floating-Point Types - 44
     CLOSED: [2019-12-16 Mon 11:20]
     - =from Jian=
       All Java floating-point types have /partial order/.
       Because of the existence of ~Float.NaN~ and ~Double.NaN~
       + *CAUTION*:
         ~NaN~'s reside in the ~Float~ and ~Double~, NOT ~float~ and ~double~!!!

     - Java Floating-Point Types
       | Type     | Storage Requirement | Range                                   |
       |----------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------|
       | ~float~  | 4 bytes             | TODO (6 ~ 7 significant decimal digits) |
       | ~double~ | 8 bytes             | TODO (15 significant decimal digits)    |

     - Suffix for /floating-point number literals/:
       * ~f~ and ~F~ for ~float~

       * ~d~ and ~D~ for ~double~
         Since ~double~ is the defult of a /floating-point number literal/,
         mostly there is no reason to use this.

     - NOTE: TODO TODO TODO
       You can specify floating-point literals in hexadecimal.
       For example,
       0.125 = 2–3 can be written as 0x1.0p-3. In hexadecimal notation, you use a
       p, not an e, to denote the exponent. (An e is a hexadecimal digit.) Note
       that the mantissa is written in hexadecimal and the exponent in decimal.
       The base of the exponent is 2, not 10.

     - Java floating-point number follow the IEEE 754 spec, and there are *3*
       special floating-point values to denote overflows and errors:
       + Positive infinity
       + Negagtive infinity
       + NaN (not a number)

     - How to get these special values (=from Jian= not exhaustive???):
       + Positive infinity:
         Divide a positive number by 0

       + NaN:
         The squre root of a negative number

     - NOTE:
       ~NaN~ equals nothing, and it even doesn't have the equality to itself.
       Use ~Float.isNaN~ / ~Dboule.isNaN~ to check if a value is ~NaN~.

     - CAUTION:
       If you need precise numerical computations _WITHOUT_ /roundoff errors/,
       use the ~BigDecimal~ class.

**** DONE 3.3.3 The ~char~ Type - 46
     CLOSED: [2019-12-17 Tue 21:46]
     - Some Unicode characters can be described with _one_ ~char~ value,
       while other Unicode characters require _two_ ~char~ values.
       + This is due to the width of ~char~, one ~char~ can have be expressed as
         values from ~\u0000~ to ~\uFFFF~, which can't represent all Unicode
         characters.

     - *CAUTION* =IMPORTANT=
       + *TRAP* !!!
         Unicode escape sequences are processed before the code is parsed.
         For example,
         * ~"\u0022+\u0022"~ (~\u0022~ is ~"~) is
           #+begin_src java
             // the cancatenation of two empty strings
             ""+""  // "" + ""
           #+end_src
           and the result is an empty string ~""~.

         * If you write a comment like ~// \u000A is a newline~, you will get an
           compile error because ~\u000A~ is a _newline character_.

         * If you write a comment like ~// look inside c:\users~, you will get an
           compile error because ~\u~ is not followed by _four hex digits_.

**** DONE 3.3.4 Unicode and the ~char~ Type - 47 - TODO
     CLOSED: [2019-12-17 Tue 22:50]
     - code point :: a code value that is associated with a character in an encoding
                     scheme.

     - surrogates area :: TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO ???
          U+D800 to U+DBFF for the first code unit;
          U+DC00 to U+DFFF for the second code unit.

     - UTF-16 :: a scheme of encoding that represents all /Unicode code points/ in
                 a variable-length code.
       + The characters in the /basic multilingual plance/ are represented as
         16-bit values, call /code units/.

       + The /supplementary characters/ are encoded as *consecutive pairs* of /code units/.

       + Each of the values in such an encoding pair falls into a range of 2048
         unused values of the basic multilingual plane, called the /surrogates
         area/ (U+D800 to U+DBFF for the first code unit, U+DC00 to U+DFFF for
         the second code unit). This is rather clever, because you can
         immediately tell whether a code unit encodes a single character or it
         is the first or second part of a supplementary character. For example,
         Image (the mathematical symbol for the set of octonions,
         http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions) has code point U+1D546 and is
         encoded by the two code units U+D835 and U+DD46. (See
         https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2781 for a description of the encoding
         algorithm.) TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO !!! TODO TODO TODO

     - History:
       1. In the 1980s, a fixed 2-byte code was more than sufficient to encode all
          characters used in all languages in the world (at that time).

       2. In 1991, Unicode 1.0 was released,  it uses slightly _less than half_ of
          the available 65536 code values.

       3. However, overtime Unicode grew beyond 65536 characters.
            Unicode then had to update the standard and use more than 2 bytes to
          represent a Unicode character.

       4. The updaed Unicode standard has /code points/ grouped into 17 /code planes/.
          + The _first_ /code plane/, called the /basic multilingual plance/, consists
            of the "classic" Unicode characters with code points U+0000 to U+FFFF.

          + _Sixteen_ additional planes, with /code points/ U+10000 to U+10FFFF, hold
            the /supplementary characters/ -- these planes are called /supplementary
            plannes/.

       5. In Java, the ~char~ type describes a /code unit/ in the UTF-16 encoding.

       ~int fourthBitFromRight = (n & 0b1000) / 0b1000;~

     - NOTE
       Apply ~&~ or ~|~ on _booleans_, and the result will be of /boolean type/.
       They are similar to ~&&~ and ~||~, except that they are *NOT /short circuit/.*

     - *CAUTION*
       + The RHS argument of the /shift operators/ *is reduced modulo 32* if the
         LHS is not ~long~.

     The ~if/else~ construct can be cumbersome when you have to deal with
     _multiple selections with many alternatives_. Java has a ~switch~ statement
     that is exactly like the ~switch~ statement in C and C++, warts and all.

     - Use the ~-Xlint:fallthrough~ option to detect the unexpected fallthrough
       (forget ~break~).

     Java has /labeled break/ (unlike C++), though mostly people use ~break~
     without label to break the innermost structure.

     - No label ~break~ is pretty simple.
       Let's inspect /labeled break/:
       + /Label/ _MUST_ precede the outermost loop out of which you want to break.
         It also _MUST_ be followed by a colon.
         #+begin_src java
           Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
           int n;

           while (. . .) // this loop statement is tagged with the label
           {
               // . . .
               for (. . .) // this inner loop is not labeled
               {
                   System.out.print("Enter a number >= 0: ");
                   n = in.nextInt();
                   if (n < 0) // should never happen—can't go on
                       break read_data;  // break out of read_data loop
                   // . . .
               }
           }

           // this statement is executed immediately after the labeled break
           if (n < 0) // check for bad situation
           {
               // deal with bad situation
           }
           else
           {
               // carry out normal processing
           }
         #+end_src

     - NOTE
       You can label any block and _jump OUT_ of it with ~break~.
       #+begin_src java
         label:
         {
             // ...
             if (condition) break label;  // exits block
             // ...
         }
         // jumps here when the break statement executes
       #+end_src
       However, you _can NEVER jump INTO_ a block.

     - The ~continue~ statement transfers control to the header of the _innermost_
       enclosing loop.

     - There is also a /labeled continue/ that jumps to the header of the loop with
       the matching label.

     - *TIP*
       ~break~ and ~continue~ statements are often confusing.
       You can always express the same logic without ~break~ and ~continue~.
       + =from Jian=
         Therefore, everytime you use them, you should justify yourself.
         I believe that there are some situations ~break~ and ~continue~ can be
         a greate solution. I have this belief especially because Java is still
         a imperative language, and imperative solutions may require some
         imperative ways with ~break~ and ~continue~.

       + The object's _state_ :: how does the object react when you invoke those

    - reflective :: A program that can *analyze* the capabilities of /classes/.

    - You can use /reflection/ mechanism to:
      + *Analyze the capabilities* of /classes/ _at runtime_;

      + *Inspect objects* _at runtime_ --
        for example, to write a single ~toString~ method that works for all classes;
        =TODO= =???=

      + Implement generic array manipulation code;

      + Take advantage of ~Method~ /objects/ that work just _like_ /function pointers/
        in languages such as C++.

    - /Reflection/ is a _powerful_ and _complex_ mechanism;
      however, it is of interest MAINLY TO _tool builders_, NOT _application
      programmers_.

**** DONE 5.7.1 The ~Class~ Class - 261
     CLOSED: [2019-05-17 Fri 12:26]
     - While your program is running, the Java runtime system always maintains what
       is called runtime type identification on all objects. This information
       keeps track of the class to which each object belongs. Runtime type
       information is used by the virtual machine to select the correct methods
       to execute.

     - ~Class.forName~ accept a string parameter like ="java.util.Random"=
       =TODO= NOTE

     - *TIP*:
       + =TODO= JVM class file loading

       + At startup, the class containing your main method is loaded. It loads all
         classes that it needs. Each of those loaded classes loads the classes that it
         needs, and so on. That can take a long time for a big application, frustrating the
         user.You can give the users of your program an illusion of a faster start with
         the following trick. Make sure the class containing the main method does not explicitly
         refer to other classes. In it, display a splash screen. Then manually force
         the loading of other classes by calling Class.forName.

     - Obtain an object of type ~Class~ is a convenient shorthand.
       If ~T~ is ANY Java type (or the ~void~ keyword), then ~T.class~ is the
       matching /class object/.
       + For example:
         #+begin_src java
           Class cl1 = Random.class;  // if you import `java.util.*`
           Class cl2 = int.class;
           Class cl3 = Double[].class;
         #+end_src

     - *NOTE*
       *The ~Class~ /class/ is actually a /generic class/.* For example,
       ~Employee.class~ is of type ~Class<Employee>~.
       =TODO=
         We are not dwelling on this issue because it would further complicate an
       already abstract concept. For most practical purposes, you can ignore the
       type parameter and work with the raw Class type. See Chapter 8 for more
       information on this issue.

     - *CAUTION*
       For historical reasons, the ~getName~ /method/ returns somewhat strange names
       for /array types/ (=from Jian= this is their representations in java class
       file):
       + ~Double[].class.getName()~ returns ~"[Ljava.lang.Double;"~
       + ~int[].class.getName()~ returns ~"[I"~

     - =from Jian=
       + Why there is no ~;~ at end of the ~int[].class.getName()~ result???

     - The JVM manages a *unique* ~Class~ object for EACH /type/.
       Therefore, *you can use the ~==~ operator to compare /class objects/:*
       ~e.getClass() == Employee.class~

     - Create an /instance/ of a /class/ _on the fly_.
       ~e.getClass().newInstance();~ -- an exception is thrown if the /class/ does
       _NOT_ have a /no-argument constructor/.

     - A combination of ~forName~ and ~newInstance~ lets you create an object from
       a _class name_ stored in a string:
       #+begin_src java
         String s = "java.util.Random";
         Object m = Class.forName(s).newInstance();
       #+end_src

     - *NOTE*
       When you need to provide parameters for the constructor of a class,
       use the ~java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Object[] args)~ /method/.
       =TODO= See section 5.7.6 for more info on how to supply parameters. =TODO=

**** TODO 5.7.4 Using Reflection to Analyze the Capabilities of Classes - 265
     Here is a brief overview of the most important parts of the reflection
     mechanism for letting you examine the structure of a class.

     - There are ~Field~, ~Method~, and ~Constructor~ in the ~java.lang.reflect~
       package.

**** TODO 5.7.5 Using Reflection to Analyze Objects at Runtime - 271
**** TODO 5.7.6 Using Reflection to Write Generic Array Code - 276
     The ~Array~ /class/ in the ~java.lang.reflect~ /package/ allows you to _create
     /arrays/ dynamically_.

     - This is used, for example, in the implementation of the ~copyOf~ /method/ in
       the ~Arrays~ /class/.
       #+begin_src java
         Employee[] a = new Employee[100];
         // ...
         // array is full
         a = Arrays.copyOf(a, 2 * a.length);
       #+end_src
       + Q :: How can one write such a /generic method/?
              It helps that an ~Employee[]~ array can be converted to an
              ~Object[]~ array. =???=
       + A :: xx
         * Bad and useless solution:
           #+begin_src java
             pbulic static Object[] badCopyOf(Object[] a, int newLength) // not useful
             {
                 Object[] newArray = new Object[newLength];
                 System.arraycopy(a, 0, newArray, 0, Math.min(a.length, newLength));
                 return newArray;
             }
           #+end_src
           The problem of this solution is the return type ~Object[]~ is not what
           we want!

         * Good solution:
           #+begin_src java
             public static Object goodCopyOf(Object a, int newLength) {
                 Class cl = a.getClass();
                 if (!cl.isArray())
                     return null;
                 else {
                     Class componentType = cl.getComponentType();
                     Object newArray = Array.newInstance(componentType, newLength);
                     int length = Array.getLength(a);
                     System.arraycopy(a, 0, newArray, 0, Math.min(length, newLength));
                     return newArray;

           little you can do, beyond notifying the user and trying to termiate the
           program gracefully.

         * ~Erro~ is quite RARE.

       + ~Exception~ has _TWO_ /DIRECT subclass/, see above.
         * The rule "if it is a ~RuntimeException~, it was your fault" works pretty
           well. For example, ~ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException~ and ~NullPointerException~.
           - =from Jian=
             There is another situation, sometimes you just want to throw out an
             /exception/ and terminate your program, but the /exception/ is by
             accident a /checked exception/. People often wrap this /exception/ info
             in to a ~RuntimeException~, and throw it.

           - ~Error~ and ~RuntimeException~ belong to the category called as
             /unchecked exception/. All other exceptions are /checked exceptions/.

     - *C++ Note*
       C++ has *TWO* FUNDAMENTAL /exception classes/:
       + ~runtime_error~: unpredictable problems --
         completely opposite to the throwables that are not ~RuntimeException~.

       Call ~optionalValue.orElseThrow()~ to *make explicit* that the method

         The hope is that programmers will only call that method when it is

       + =from Jian=
         This is a standard Java style (imperative language style, or no strong
         enough type system language style) -- the dirty solution is Okay if the
         danger is explicit -- =from Jian= not a criticize.

     - ~T orElseThrow()~ since Java 10

     - Here are a few more tips for the proper use of the ~Optional~ type:
       + _A variable of type ~Optional~ should never be ~null~._
         =from Jian=
         This is not an issue of ~Optional~.
         This is an issue of Java that it can't remove ~null~ from the language
         itself -- for a real world language, we must deal with backward
         compatibility issue.

       + _Don't use fields of type ~Optional~._
         The cost is an additional object.
         Inside a class, using ~null~ for an absent field is manageable.

       + _Don't put ~Optional~ objects in a /set/, and don't use them as /keys/

     The stream method turns an ~Optional<T>~ into a ~Stream<T>~ with zero or one
     element.

     - Q :: Sure, why not, but why would you ever want that?
     - A :: Answer by example: Suppose you have a stream of user IDs and a method
            ~Optional<User> lookup(String id)~.
       + Q :: How do you get a /stream/ of users, skipping those invalid IDs?
       + A :: Here are _two_ ways:
         * Naive and not elegant, though it is safe even though it uses ~isPresent~ and ~get~.
           #+begin_src java
             Stream<String> ids = ...;
             Stream<User> users = ids.map(Users::lookup)
                 .filter(Optional::isPresent)
                 .map(Optional::get);
           #+end_src
           We still want to avoid the /look unsafe methods/ (low level API),
           especially in a not-low-level application.

         * Elegant way with no _low level API_:
           #+begin_src java
             Stream<User> users = ids.map(Users::lookup).flatMap(Optional::stream);
           #+end_src

     - NOTE
       An example of work with the exist _return ~null~ methods_:
       #+begin_src java
         // `Users::classicLookup` can return `null`

         // 1
         Stream<User> users = ids.map(Users::classicLookup).filter(Objects::nonNull);

         // 2
         Stream<User> users = ids.flatMap(id -> Stream.ofNullable(Users::classicLookup(id)))

         // 3
         Stream<User> users = ids.map(Users::classicLookup).flatMap(Stream::ofNullable);
       #+end_src
       + =from Jian=
         Since ~Stream~ is /lazy/, I don't prefer the *2* way, which has a nested
         function call. It is not as readable as *1* and *3*.

** DONE Chapter 6: The Date and Time API - TODO =READ-API-DOC=
   CLOSED: [2019-12-19 Thu 12:24]
   Time is simple, but deal with humans time is complicated!!!
   - In this chapter, you will learn
     + what makes time computations so vexing
     + how the Date and Time API solves these issues.

*** DONE 6.1 The Time Line
    CLOSED: [2019-12-19 Thu 01:29]
    - The Java Date and Time API specification requires that Java uses a time scale
      that (these give Java the flexibility to adjust to future changes in the
      official time TODO TODO TODO =WHY= ???):
      + Has 86,400 seconds per day (smoothing /leap seconds/)
      + Exactly matches the official time at noon each day
      + Closely matches it elsewhere, in a precisely defined way

    - ~java.time.Instant~ represents a point on the time line (=from Jian= the role
      of, though not officially, effectively deprecated ~java.util.Date~).

    - ~Instant~ has nanosecond precision.

    - ~Instant.MIN~ and ~Instant.MAX~ -- they are in billion years order, which
      is enough to describe all practical purposes for human society, though not
      enough to describe the age of the universe (around 13.5 billion years).

    - ~Instant.now()~

    - duration (in java time concepts) :: the amount of time between two instants.

    - Use ~Duration.between~ to find out the difference between two /instants/.

    - Get the lenght of a ~Duration~ in conventional units by calling ~toNanos~,
      ~toMillis~, ~toSeconds~, ~toMinutes~, ~toHours~, or ~toDays~.
      + NOTE
        In Java 8, there is no ~toSeconds~, and you had to call ~getSeconds~ instead.
        * =from Jian= ~toSeconds~ and ~getSeconds~ have the same implementation.
          _WHY_ Java 9 add ~toSeconds~ /methods/ and not deprecate ~getSeconds~
          /method/?

        * A ~long~ can hold almost 300 years of *nanoseconds*.
          *ONLY* when your durations are shorter than that, ~toNanos~ can work
          without /overflow/.
          - =from Jian=
            Good news is that if it /overflow/, you can see an ~ArithmeticException~.
            I get this info by reading the comment of ~toNanos~

    - *The ~Instant~ and ~Duration~ object are _IMMUTABLE_.*

    - ~instant.plus~, ~instant.minus~, ~duration.plus~, and ~duration.minus~
      require ~TemporalAmount~ type parameter, and both ~Duration~ and ~Period~
      implement the ~TemporalAmount~ interface.

    - The ~Duration.between~ /method/ requires ~Temporal~ interface type parameters,
      and the ~Instant~ class as well as ~LocalDate~ / ~LocalDateTime~ / ~LocalTime~
      implements ~Temporal~.

*** DONE 6.2 Local Dates
    CLOSED: [2019-12-19 Thu 04:27]
    In the last section we discussed the _absolute time_, and this section we will
    discuss _human time_.

    - There are *TWO* kinds of human time in the Java API:
      + local date/time (doesn't include time zone info)
      + zoned time

    - Recommendation:
      Don't use zoned time unless you really want to represent _ABSOLUTE time
      instances_.
      + For example,
        Birthday, holidays, schedule times, and so on are usually best represented
        as /locate dates or times/.

    - *UNLIKE* the irregular conventions in UNIX and ~java.util.Date~, where _months
      are zero-based_ and _years are counted from 1900_, you supply the usual numbers
      or correponding ~Month~ enumeration for the month of year.

    - The difference between two time instants of type ~Instant~ is a ~Duration~.
      The difference between two time local dates of type ~LocalDate~ is a ~Period~.

    - The ~LocalDate~ API take the /leap year/ into account, therefore, for example,
      when you calculate a birthday of next year from a given birthday,
      + the *RIGHT* ways
        * ~birthday.plus(Period.ofYears(1))~
        * ~birthday.plusYears(1)~

      + the *WRONG* way
        ~birthday.plus(Period.ofDays(365))~

    - =from Jian=
      + To get a /duration/ between two /instants/, we can
        * Use /static method/ ~Duration.between~
        * Use /instance method/ ~until(anotherInstant, timeUnit)~ (not exact types in code)

      + Similarly, to get a /period/ between two /local dates/, we can
        * Use /static method/ ~Period.between~
        * Use /instance method/ ~until(anotherLocalDate, timeUnit)~ (not exact types in code)

    - ~Instant~ has only one ~until~ /method/ with signature
      ~long until(Temporal endExclusive, TemporalUnit unit)~,
      while ~LocalDate~ has two ~unitl~ /methods/ with signatures
      ~long until(Temporal endExclusive, TemporalUnit unit)~ and ~Period until(Temporal endExclusive)~

    - =from Jian=
      You can't recover the exact time lapse from a ~Period~ instances.
      Once a ~Period~ instance is created, the infomation about the start and
      end dates are lost. Since different monthes has different days, the days
      in a February can change because of existence of /leap days/.
      + Because of this reason, if you want to know the exact time lapse, don't use
        the ~Period until(Temporal endExclusive)~ method of ~LocalDate~, and use
        the other ~long until(Temporal endExclusive, TemporalUnit unit)~.

    - ~LocalDate.of(1900, Month.January, 1).getDayOfWeek()~
      returns a enumeration value of ~DayOfWeek~.
      ~DayOfWeek~ enumeration values count from ~DayOfWeek.MONDAY~ of value ~1~.

    - ~DayOfWeek~ enumeration has convenience /methods/ ~plus~ and ~minus~ to
      compute weekdays modulo 7.

    - NOTE
      + ~java.time.DayOfWeek~'s /weekend days/ actually come at the end of the week.
      + ~java.util.Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK~ has ~Sunday~ has value 1 and ~Saturday~ value 7.
        * =from Jian=
          This is why we shouldn't use ~Calendar~ even if it is not yet marked DEPRECATED.

    - Java 9 adds two useful /methods/ ~datesUntil~ that yield /streams/ of ~LocalDate~
      objects:
      #+begin_src java
        LocalDate start = LocalDate.of(2000, 1, 1);
        LocalDate endExclusive = LocalDate.now();
        Stream<LocalDate> allDays = start.datesUntil(endExclusive);
        Stream<LocalDate> firstDaysInMonth = start.datesUntil(endExclusive, Period.ofMonths(1));
        start.datesUntil(endExclusive, Period.ofMonths(1));
      #+end_src

    - Partial date info classes:
      + ~MonthDay~
      + ~YearMonth~
      + ~Year~

*** DONE 6.3 Date Adjusters - TODO _READ API DOC in the book_
    CLOSED: [2019-12-19 Thu 04:49]
    From the name of ~TemporalAdjusters~, according to the naming convention of
    Java library, we know it's a /utility class/ (a container for a group of
    /static methods/).

    - /Adjusters/ are used to do calculation like "get the first Tuesday of every
      month."
      #+begin_src java
        LocalDate firstTuesday = LocalDate.of(year, month, 1)
            .with(TemporalAdjusters.nextOrSame(DayOfWeek.TUESDAY));
      #+end_src

    - Make your own /adjuster/ by _implementing_ the ~TemporalAdjuster~ /interface/.
      Here is an /adjuster/ for computing the next weekday:
      #+begin_src java
        TemporalAdjuster NEXT_WORKDAY = w ->
        {
            var result = (LocalDate) w;
            do
            {
                result = result.plusDays(1);
            } while (result.getDayOfWeek().getValue() >= 6);

            return result;
        };

        LocalDate backToWork = today.with(NEXT_WORKDAY);
      #+end_src
      You must cast the ~Temporal~ type ~w~ to ~LocalDate~ to do your further
      calculation.
      + A better solution, *NO* /cast/:
        #+begin_src java
          TemporalAdjuster NEXT_WORKDAY = TemporalAdjusters.ofDateAdjuster(w ->
            {
                var result = w;  // NO cast
                do
                {
                    result = result.plusDays(1);
                } while (result.getDayOfWeek().getValue() >= 6);

                return result;
            });
        #+end_src

*** DONE 6.4 Local Time
    CLOSED: [2019-12-19 Thu 04:31]
    A ~LocalTime~ represents a time of day, such as 15:30:00.
    A ~LocalDateTime~ represents a date and the time of day.

    - The ~toString~ representation of ~LocalTime~ is a 24 hours form.
      NO AM/PM, which is a formatter issue. TODO See "Section 6.6".

*** DONE 6.5 Zoned Time
    CLOSED: [2019-12-19 Thu 11:48]
    - /Time zones/ are complicated due to
      1. They are an entirely human creation, are even messier than the complications
         caused by the _earth's irregular rotation_.
      2. Their _irregular and shifting boundaries_ and, to make matters worse, the
         /daylight savings time/.

    - The /Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)/ keeps a database of all known
      time zones around the world (http://www.iana.org/time-zones), which is updated
      several times per year.

    - Java uses the IANA database.

    - *Each time zone has an ID*.

    - Call ~ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds~ to get all available time zones.

    - At the time of this wrting, there are almost 600 IDs.

    - Use ~ZonedId.of(id)~ to get the a ~ZonedId~ object.

    - Call ~localDateTime.atZone(zoneId)~ to get a ~ZonedDateTime~ object from a
      ~LocalDateTime~ object.

    - You can also construct a ~ZonedDateTime~ by calling the /static method/
      ~ZonedDateTime.of(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, nano, zoneId)~
      For example,
      #+begin_src java
        ZonedDateTime apollo11launch = ZonedDateTime.of(1969, 7, 16, 9, 32, 0, 0, ZoneId.of("America/New_York"));
        // 1969-07-16T09:32-04:00[America/New_York]
      #+end_src

    - ~ZonedDateTime~ <--> ~Instant~
      + Call ~zonedDateTime.toInstant~ to get an ~Instant~ object.
      + Call ~instant.atZone(zoneId)~ to get an ~ZonedDateTime~ object.

    - NOTE
      /UTC/ is a _compromise_ between "Coordinated Universal Time" (En) and
      "Temps Universel Coordiné", having the distinction of being incorrect in
      either language.
      + UTC is the time at the Greenwich Royal Observatory, without /daylight saving
        time/.

    - Many of the /methods/ of ~ZonedDateTime~ are the _SAME_ as those of ~LocalDateTime~
      (see the API notes at the end of this section).
      + Most are straightforward,
      + *but daylight savings time introduces some complications.*

    - Deal with /daylight saving time/:
      + Get a /daylight saving time/ ~ZonedDateTime~ object from the time before
        _START /daylight saving time/:_
        #+begin_src java
          ZonedDateTime skipped = ZonedDateTime.of(LocalDate.of(2013, 3, 31),
                                                   LocalTime.of(2, 30),
                                                   ZoneId.of("Europe/Berlin"));
          // Constructs March 31 3:30
          // NOT the nonexistent time March 31 2:30
        #+end_src

      + Get a not /daylight saving time/ ~ZonedDateTime~ object from the time of
        a _/daylight saving time/_:
        #+begin_src java
          // `ZonedDateTime.of` always create the earlier one
          ZonedDateTime ambiguous = ZonedDateTime.of(LocalDate.of(2013, 10, 27), // End of daylight savings time
                                                     LocalTime.of(2, 30),
                                                     ZoneId.of("Europe/Berlin"));
          // 2013-10-27T02:30+02:00[Europe/Berlin]

          // Use this way to get the later one.
          // You can see they have the same local time but different time zone.
          ZonedDateTime anHourLater = ambiguous.plusHours(1);
          // 2013-10-27T02:30+01:00[Europe/Berlin]
        #+end_src

      + *CAUTION*
        *ATTENTION*!!!
        _Adjusting a date across daylight savings time boundaries_.
        For example,
        if you set a meeting for next week,
        what you actually want is ~meetingTime.plus(Period.ofDays(7))~, and it
        shouldn't not ~meetingTime.plus(Duration.ofDays(7))~.
        * The plus /duration/ is not wrong, it is just not what you want!

        * =from Jian= =IMPORTANT=
          Most you want to work with _non-human-involved time_ (~Instant~ and
          ~Duration~) and _human-involved time_ (~ZonedDateTime~, ~LocalDateTime~,
          and ~Period~) *separately*.
