* Preface: What to look for.
** Why: Why learn Emacs Lisp?
** On Reading this Text: Read, gain familiarity, pick up habits....
** Who You Are: For whom this is written.
** Lisp History	
** Note for Novices: You can read this as a novice.
** Thank You

* List Processing: What is Lisp?
** Lisp Lists: What are lists?
*** Numbers Lists: List have numbers, other lists, in them.
*** Lisp Atoms: Elemental entities.
*** Whitespace in Lists: Formatting lists to be readable.
*** Typing Lists: How GNU Emacs helps you type lists.

** Run a Program: Any list in Lisp is a program ready to run.
** Making Errors: Generating an error message.
** Names & Definitions: Names of symbols and function definitions.
** Lisp Interpreter: What the Lisp interpreter does.
*** Complications: Variables, Special forms, Lists within.
*** Byte Compiling: Specially processing code for speed.

** Evaluation: Running a program.
*** How the Interpreter Acts: Returns and Side Effects...
*** Evaluating Inner Lists: Lists within lists...

** Variables: Returning a value from a variable.
*** fill-column Example	
*** Void Function: The error message for a symbol without a function.
*** Void Variable: The error message for a symbol without a value.

** Arguments: Passing information to a function.
*** Data types: Types of data passed to a function.
*** Args as Variable or List: An argument can be the value of a variable or list.
*** Variable Number of Arguments: Some functions may take a variable number of arguments.
*** Wrong Type of Argument: Passing an argument of the wrong type to a function.
*** message: A useful function for sending messages.

** _set_ & _setq_: Setting the value of a variable.
*** Using _set_: Setting values.
*** Using _setq_: Setting a quoted value.
*** Counting: Using setq to count.

** Summary: The major points.
