*** "Telling the Monkeys What to Do" - 177
    - Most computers spend a lot of time doing nothing.
        If you start a system monitor tool and watch the CPU utilization, you'll
      see what I mean -- it's rare to see one hit 100 percent, even when you are
      running multiple programs. In fact, the majority of a modern CPU's capacity
      is often spent in an idle state; faster chips help speed up performance
      demand peaks, but much of their power can go largely unused.

    - Early on in computing, programmers realized that they could tap into such unused
      processing power by running more than one program at the same time. By dividing the
      CPU’s attention among a set of tasks, its capacity need not go to waste while any given
      task is waiting for an external event to occur. The technique is usually called parallel
      processing (and sometimes “multiprocessing” or even “multitasking”) because many
      tasks seem to be performed at once, overlapping and parallel in time. It’s at the heart
      of modern operating systems, and it gave rise to the notion of multiple-active-window
      computer interfaces we’ve all come to take for granted. Even within a single program,
      dividing processing into tasks that run in parallel can make the overall system faster,
      at least as measured by the clock on your wall.

    - Just as important is that modern software systems are expected to be responsive
      to users regardless of the amount of work they must perform behind the scenes.
      It’s usually unacceptable for a program to stall while busy carrying out a
      request. Consider an email-browser user interface, for example; when asked
      to fetch email from a server, the program must download text from a server
      over a network. If you have enough email or a slow enough Internet link,
      that step alone can take minutes to finish. But while the download task
      proceeds, the program as a whole shouldn’t stall—it still must respond to
      screen redraws, mouse clicks, and so on.

    - Parallel processing comes to the rescue here, too. By performing such long-running
      tasks in parallel with the rest of the program, the system at large can remain
      responsive no matter how busy some of its parts may be. Moreover, the parallel
      processing model is a natural fit for structuring such programs and others;
      some tasks are more easily conceptualized and coded as components running as
      independent, parallel entities.

    - There are two fundamental ways to get tasks running at the same time in Python
      -- process forks and spawned threads. Functionally, both rely on underlying
      operating system services to run bits of Python code in parallel. Procedurally,
      they are very different in terms of interface, portability, and communication.
      For instance, at this writing direct process forks are not supported on
      Windows under standard Python (though they are underCygwin Python on Windows).

    - By contrast, Python’s thread support works on all major platforms. Moreover,
      the os.spawn family of calls provides additional ways to launch programs in
      a platformneutral way that is similar to forks, and the os.popen and
      ~os.system~ calls and subprocess module we studied in Chapters 2 and 3 can
      be used to portably spawn programs with shell commands. The newer
      multiprocessing module offers additional ways to run processes portably in
      many contexts.

    - In this chapter, which is a continuation of our look at system interfaces
      available to Python programmers, we explore Python’s built-in tools for
      starting tasks in parallel, as well as communicating with those tasks. In
      some sense, we’ve already begun doing so—os.system, os.popen, and subprocess,
      which we learned and applied over the last three chapters, are a fairly
      portable way to spawn and speak with command-line programs, too. We won't
      repeat full coverage of those tools here.

    - Instead, our emphasis in this chapter is on introducing more direct techniques
      -- forks, threads, pipes, signals, sockets, and other launching techniques --
      and on using Python’s built-in tools that support them, such as the ~os.fork~
      call and the threading, queue, and multiprocessing modules. In the next
      chapter (and in the remainder of this book), we use these techniques in
      more realistic programs, so be sure you understand the basics here before
      flipping ahead.

    - One note up front: although the process, thread, and IPC mechanisms we will
      explore in this chapter are the primary parallel processing tools in
      Python scripts, the third party domain offers additional options which may
      serve more advanced or specialized roles. As just one example, the MPI for
      Python system allows Python scripts to also employ the Message Passing
      Interface (MPI) standard, allowing Python programs to exploit multiple
      processors in various ways (see the Web for details). While such specific
      extensions are beyond our scope in this book, the fundamentals of
      multiprocessing that we will explore here should apply to more advanced
      techniques you may encounter in your parallel futures.
