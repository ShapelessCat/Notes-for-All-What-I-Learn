* What is JVM - 1
** Primitives and references - 2
** Operations - 5
   - In general, JVM follows the /von Neumann architecture/.
     * When you do computation,
       + some part of your memory contains _data_ the program operates on
       + some part of your memory contains the _program itself_.

     * At ANY given moment:
       1. the computer knows that it is at exactly this point of the program,
          by keeping trace of the memory address of current instruction,

       2. the computer fetches the instruction from under the address,

       3. then executes it,

       4. after that it moves to the next instruction in the memory - unless the
          instruction was to jump to another part of the program it would be the
          next instruction right after the one we just finished.

   - This /memory address/ of a program on JVM is, again, an implementation detail.
     * JVM specification would tell you that EACH /thread/ knows its /program counter
       (pc)/, telling at which instruction of which method it is currently.

   - Additionally,
     * computer can have /registers/ which store data that are intended to use by
       the *current* operation.

     * /Instructions/, whether it is CPU's instruction, or JVM's bytecode,
       USUALLY *only* operate on these /registers/ (though JVM call them /local
       variables/), taking values to process from them and storing the result in
       /registers/ as well. (Exceptions would be things like _loading data from the
       memory to registers and vice versa_).

   - =TODO= NOTE =TODO=
     
** More about memory - 9
   - /Memory/ can be _imagined as_ a big array where indices are memory addresses.

   - This /memory/ can be divided into the part that contains
     * program
     * the part that contains data.
     _But we could break it even more!_ =from Jian= when not consider the details.

   - As a matter of the fact,
     we can break the _data part_ of the /memory/ into
     * /stacks/ (one per each thread)
     * a heap (common for all threads).

*** Stack - 9
    - When we step into a /function/,
      /compiler/ can calculate some things e.g.:
      * *how many* /local variables/ will we need during a whole call

      * *how much space* will they take
        + /primitives/' size depend of their type
        + /references/ have a fixed size

    - It means, that every time compiler step into a /function/, it knows perfectly
      how much size it needs in order to be able to call /function/.
      * frame :: the description holding all pieces of information about a call.

    - What JVM does when it calls a /function/ is creation of a new /frame/ for it,
      populating the /variables/ storing arguments and putting in on a /stack/.
      * This /stack of frames/ is *separate from* /stack of operands/ (which we
        saw in action in the example above)

    - How the /stack/ of /frames/ looks like, we can see every time we receive an
      ~Exception~. An example in Ammonite:
      =TODO=
      As we can see, Ammonite has a method <clinit> which called method d, which
      called c, which called b, which called a which threw Exception, and
      Exception preserved information about the state of stack at the moment of
      its creation. It is one of these build-in mechanisms of JVM, that makes
      our life much easier than e.g. C/C++ programmer’s life (who not only would
      get crash, but also without much information to figure out the cause).

    - Similarly to C and C++, /JVM stack/ is intended to be _relatively SMALL._
      * Each /frame/ contains _ONLY_ /references/ or /primitives/,
        so it shouldn't grow too large,

      * depth of calls is also expected to be finite and small,
        so that whole /stack/ is _usually UNDER a few megabytes in size._
