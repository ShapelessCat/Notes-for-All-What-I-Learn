  - In this chapter
    + Why scaling is hard
    + Write once, scale anywhere
    + Introduction to the actor programming model
    + Akka actors
    + What is Akka?

  - History:
    + Up until the middle of the 90's, just before the internet revolution,
      most applications would only ever run on a single computer a single CPU.

      At that time, if an app is slow, just wait a free lunch -- the rapid
      upgrade of hardware.

    + In 2005 Herb Sutter wrote in Dr. Dobb's Journal:
      http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm

      In short:
      a limit to increasing CPU clock speeds has been reached, and the free
      lunch is over.

    + Call for /concurrency/!
      /Concurrency/ SHOULD ALSO MEANS to achieve scalability.

   We only need the =chapter-up-and-running= part, which is for this chapter.

   - We'll use /sbt/, /Git/, the /Heroku toolbelt/, and ~httpie~ (an easy to use
     command-line HTTP client) in this chapter.

   - We use sbt 0.13.7, Scala 2.11 and Akka 2.4 (requires Java 8).

   - =from Jian=
     + I'm not very familiar with sbt, and I won't change it version, though 0.13.7 is old.

     + Use the newest Akka 2.5.16.

     + I modified the _dependency_ part of the =build.sbt= of this project:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         enablePlugins(JavaServerAppPackaging)

         name := "goticks"

         version := "1.0"

         scalaVersion := "2.12.6"

         organization := "com.goticks"

         libraryDependencies ++= {
           val akkaVersion = "2.5.16"
           Seq(
             "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-actor"      % akkaVersion,
             "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-http-core"  % "10.1.5",
             "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-http-spray-json"  % "10.1.5",
             "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-stream"     % akkaVersion,
             "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-slf4j"      % akkaVersion,
             "ch.qos.logback"    %  "logback-classic" % "1.2.3",
             "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-testkit"    % akkaVersion    % Test,
             "org.scalatest"     %% "scalatest"       % "3.2.0-SNAP10" % Test
           )
         }

         // Assembly settings
         mainClass in assembly := Some("com.goticks.Main")

         assemblyJarName in assembly := "goticks.jar"
       #+END_SRC

     + I also modified the code to coordinate with these changes!!!

   CLOSED: [2018-09-21 Fri 22:01]
   - First, we'll work on how to _test SENDING and RECEIVING /messages/,_
     + in fire-and-forget style (one-way)
     + in by request-response style (two-way) interaction

   - Use ~ScalaTest~ and the Akka testkit.

   - _Testing Actors_ is *more difficult* than testing normal objects for a couple
     of reasons:
     + *Timing*
       Sending messages is /asynchronous/,
       so it's _DIFFICULT to know WHEN to assert expected values in the unit test_.

     + *Asynchronicity*
       Actors are meant to be run in parallel on several threads.

       /Multithreaded tests/
       * are more difficult than single-threaded tests
       * require concurrency primitives like /locks/, /latches/, and /barriers/ to
         *synchronize* results from VARIOUS /actors/.
           _This is exactly the kind of thing you want to get further away from._
         Incorrect usage of just one barrier can block a unit test, which in
         turn halts the execution of a full test suite.

     + *Statelessness*
       An /actor/ *hides* its /internal state/ and does *NOT allow access to
       this state*. Access should only be possible through the ~ActorRef~.
         Calling a method on an /actor/ and checking its /state/, which is something
       you’d like to be able to do when unit testing, is prevented by design.

       =from Jian= This is why we have ~TestActorRef~!!! =TODO=

     + *Collaboration/Integration*
       If you wanted to do an integration test of a couple of /actors/, you’d need
       to eavesdrop on the /actors/ to assert that the messages have the expected
       values.

       It’s _not immediately clear_ how this can be done.

   - The /for test actor systems/ have a special requirement:
     they should stop after tests are done!

     To make life easier, we create small trait to satisfy this requirement:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       import org.scalatest.{ Suite, BeforeAndAfterAll }
       import akka.testkit.TestKit

       trait StopSystemAfterAll extends BeforeAndAfterAll {
         this: Testit with Suite =>
         override protected def afterAll() {
           super.afterAll()
           system.shutdown()
         }
       }
     #+END_SRC

** 3.2 One-way messages - 52
   *We _NO LONGER_ invoke a function and wait on the response!*,

   so

   - the fact that our examples merely send one-way messages with tell is
     *deliberate*:
     + This is a fire-and-forget style,
       we do NOT know
       1. if a message arrives an /actor/?
       2. if it arrives, when?

     + The /actors/ can do a lot of things, but if things they done are completely
       invisible from the outside, we can only check if it handled the messages
       without any errors. This is mostly way far from enough!!!

       ~TestActorRef~ can help us to look into the state of an /actors/.
       This kind of operations is NOT allowed by the plain ~ActorRef~.

     ~TestActorRef~ has three variations that we will look at:
     + ~SilentActor~
       An actor’s behavior is not directly observable from the outside; it might
       be an intermediate step that the actor takes to create some internal
       state. We want to test that the actor at least handled the message and
       didn’t throw any exceptions. We want to be sure that the actor has
       finished. We want to test the internal state change.

     + ~SendingActor~
       An actor sends a message to another actor (or possibly many actors) after
       it’s done processing the received message. We’ll treat the actor as a
       black box and inspect the message that’s sent out in response to the
       message it received

     + ~SideEffectingActor~
       An actor receives a message and interacts with a normal object in some
       kind of way. After we send a message to the actor, we’d like to assert if
       the object was affected.
