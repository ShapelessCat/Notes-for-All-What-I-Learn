  - block expression :: one or multiple statements inside ~{}~, _with the LAST
       determining the RESULT of the block_.

  - /block expressions/ are *NOT* /anonymous function/.

  - Assume ~val lst = List(1, 2)~,
    + ~lst.map(i => println("Hi"); i + 1)~ CANNOT compiled.

      The body of an /anonymous function/ can ONLY be ONE experssion. For
      example, ONLY ~i + 1~ is OK; a /block expression/ that contains multiple
      expressions is OK. However, not the code above.

    + ~lst.map(i \equal{}> { println("Hi"); i + 1 })~ will print *TWO* =Hi='s, and
      return ~List(2, 3)~.

      The /block expression/ is the body of this /anonymous function/.
      The body will be evaluated everytime its /anonymous function/ is called.
      For this example, it is evaluated two times.

    + Both ~lst.map { println("Hi"); _ + 1 }~ and ~lst.map({ println("Hi"); _ + 1 })~
      will print *ONE* =Hi=, and return ~List(2, 3)~.
  
      The /block expression/ is evaluated first, and then its *LAST* expression is
      returned as an /anonymous function/ passed to ~map~. Therefore, ONLY *one*
      =Hi= -- the ~println("Hi");~ as a part of this /block expression/ is
      evaluated once.

  - The scope of the /placeholder/ ~_~ is the exact expression that includes the
    /placeholder/. All the other parts are NOT considered as the body of an
    /anonymous function/ related to the ~_~.

     // DAY: Int = 24

     var (HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND) = (12, 0, 0)
     // <console>:11: error: not found: value HOUR

   - /Uppercase variable names/ can be used for plain, single-value assignments
     of ~val~'s and ~var~'s, as in the case of ~MONTH~ and ~DAY~.

   - Some *trickiness* arises in /pattern matching/ -- multiple-variable assignments,
     NOT LIKE single-variable assignment, are /paatern matching/.

     In /pattern matching/,

     + Variables _STARTING WITH an UPPERCASE letter_ are /stable identifiers/.
       They are intended for matching against _constants_.
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         final val TheAnswer = 42

         def checkGuess(guess: Int) = guess match {
           case TheAnswer => "Your guess is correct"
           case _ => "Try again"
         }

         checkGuess(21)
         // res0: String = Try again

         checkGuess(42)
         // res1: String = Your guess is correct
       #+END_SRC

     + Variables _STARTING WITH an LOWERCASE letter_, by contrast, define
       /variable patterns/, which cause values to be *assigned*:
       ~var (hour, minute, second) = (12, 0, 0)~

** DONE Discussion
   CLOSED: [2017-09-28 Thu 23:37]
   - If, by extreme *coincidence*, the required /stable identifiers/ are
     *in scope* the pattern matching part will compile successfully.

     At runtime, ~MatchError~ may happen is the given value of the /stable
     identifiers/ can't match the RHS value of pattern matching.
     
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       val HOUR = 12; val MINUTE, SECOND = 0;
       var (HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND) = (12, 0, 0)
       // Even if it compiles successfully, NO assignment happen.


       val HOUR = 13; val MINUTE, SECOND = 0;
       var (HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND) = (12, 0, 0)
       // scala.MatchError: (12,0,0) (of class scala.Tuple3)
       //  ...
     #+END_SRC

   - *Enclosing lowercase variables in backticks*, and then you get /stable
     identifiers/

     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       final val theAnswer = 42

       def checkGuess(guess: Int) = guess match {
         case `theAnswer` => "Your guess is correct"
         case _ => "Try again"
       }

       checkGuess(42)
       // res0: String = Your guess is correct
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       // not a `val` (should be), and not `final` either
       var theAnswer: Int = 42

       def checkGuess(guess: Int) = guess match {
         case `theAnswer` => "Your guess is correct"
         case _ => "Try again"
       }

       // <console>:9: error: stable identifier required, but
       //   theAnswer found.
       //          case `theAnswer` => "Your guess is correct"
     #+END_SRC

   - You can also use the *enclosing with backticks* way to convert keywords to
     variable names. For example, you can use ~`val`~ as a variable name.


   - We should keep the convention in other languages -- use /lowercase name/
     for ~var~'s (better still, avoid ~var~'s completely!), and /uppercase names/
     for /constants/.

     + constants (in Scala) :: variables declared as ~final val~

     =Comment from Jian=
     A example to distinguish /constant/ and /immutable quantity/:
       Suppose there are two universe follow the same physics rules (same form
     formula), and the ONLY difference is some /physics constants/. These
     /physics constants/ are actully /immutable quantities/ in each universe, not
     /constant/ in our context of discussion. A /constant/, rather than
     /immutable quantity/, should be a fixed value defined the template of these
     two universes -- the universe class. Therefore, for this example, a good
     choice is the ~static final val~.

     Declared as ~final~ _PREVENTS subclasses from overriding them_, and has an
     additional performance benefit in that the compiler can /inline/ them.

   - _SUMMARY_
     Use *uppercase* variable names ONLY for /constants/.

  Q: What does the following program print?
  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    def sumSizes(collections: Iterable[Iterable[_]]): Int =
      collections.map(_.size).sum

    sumSizes(List(Set(1, 2), List(3, 4)))
    sumSizes(Set(List(1, 2), Set(3, 4)))
  #+END_SRC

  A: Prints:
     Int = 4
     Int = 2

*** Explanation 
    - If we create a ~sumSizes~ (with the same type signature as above) function
      in Java
      + both the result will be two 4's.

      + the intermediate result of ~collections.map(_.size)~ (in the body of
        ~sumSizes~ definition) should be ~Iterable[Int]~.

    - In Scala, the intermediate result of ~collections.map(_.size)~ (in the body
      of ~sumSizes~ definition) should be a more specific result which satisfies
      ~Iterable[Int]~.
      + For ~sumSizes(List(Set(1, 2), List(3, 4)))~, it should be ~List[Int]~.
        ~List(2, 2).sum~  is 4.

      + For ~sumSizes(Set(List(1, 2), Set(3, 4)))~, it should be ~Set[Int]~.
        ~Set(2, 2).sum~ is actually ~Set(2).sum~, which is 2.

      There is NO warning about the second, which is BAD.
      This time Java does the right thing.
      Why Scala make decision to do the calculation in this way?????? =TODO=

*** Discussion
    Solutions:
    - Convert the outer collection to a known type, e.g., using ~toSeq~:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        def sumSizes(collections: Iterable[Iterable[_]]): Int =
          collections.toSeq.map(_.size).sum
      #+END_SRC

    - Even better, implement ~sumSizes~ with ~fold~ rather than ~map~, then you
      can avoid the problem and eliminate one of the iterations through the outer
      collection (use ~map~, we need ~sum~ that follows it; with ~fold~, we get
      the result directly):
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        def sumSizes(collections: Iterable[Iterable[_]]): Int =
          collections.foldLeft(0) {
            (sumOfSizes, collection) => sumOfSizes + collection.size
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - SUMMARY:
      Pay close attention to the possible input types to your methods that
      operate on collections.
        If you do not need to preserve the input type, consider constructing
      your own intermediate types with known characteristics.

   The answer is 2:
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Prints:
   1
   #+END_QUOTE

   - IN ADDITION TO a _postponed evaluation_,
     /lazy values/ have the interesting property that _if an /exception/ is thrown
     *during their initialization*, they will be *recomputed* when accessed again._

** Discussion - 76
   - Another example about the property of exception thrown during the initialization
     of a /lazy value/.
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       import io.Source

       lazy val res = Source.fromFile("./processing-result.txt").
         getLines.filter(_.contains("quux"))
     #+END_SRC

     If ~res~ is referenced before the file is available, it will throw an
     exception during initialization and signal to the calling code that the
     collection of data has not been completed.
       Once the result file is written, ~res~ will be properly initialized and
     will then hold the expected value.

   - *SUMMARY*
     Scala will *reattempt* to initialize ~lazy val~'s on each access *until
     initialization succeeds*.

     This makes them a useful option for _postponed resource initialization_.

  #+END_SRC
  
** Possibilities - 79
** Explanation - 79
   The answer 1
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Roman numeral symbols for 1 5 10 50 100 500 1000:
   I V X L C D M
   C D I L M V X
   #+END_QUOTE

   - ~SortedSet~ is ordered with the help of the ~compare~ /method/ of the ~Ordering~
     /class/. _It doesn't keep the insertion order!!!_

   - On of the main features of Scala collections is that transformations, such
     as ~map~, *preserve the type of the collection*.

     In this case, ~map~ generate a value of ~SortedSet[String]~, whoes elements
     have a different order from the input ~SortedSet[RomanNumeral]~.
       This is why the two output are different.

   - According to _The Scala Language Specification_, the ~for (i - expr) { fun(i) }~
     loop is *desugared* to an invocation of the ~foreach~ /method/:
     ~expr foreach { i => fun(i) }.~

     In our case, this conversion is more complicated:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       numerals map { num =>
         val sym = num.symbol
         (num, sym)
       } foreach { case (num, sym) =>
           println(sym)
       }
     #+END_SRC
     Here after the ~map~ operation, a value of ~SortedSet[(RomanNumeral, String)]~
     is generated, and, according to the order of tuples, we know the new generated
     ~SortedSet~ keep the order of the input.

** Discussion - 81
   - You can use create a ~view~ from the input and ~map~, the /view/ does NOT
     create an intermediate ~SortedSet~. Instead, the ~num => num.symbol~
     operation is applied *lazily*, only when the next element of the
     transformed ~numerals~ collection is retrieved and printed in the ~foreach~
     loop.
     ~numerals.view map { _.symbol } foreach { sym => print(s"${sym} ") }~

   - As of Scala 2.11, however, there is *still significant debate regarding the
     usability of /views/.*
     =From Jian=  I guess now this debate already has a result:
     Scala 2.13 new collection library introduce ~View~.

     + _A simple ALTERNATIVE_ is to start with a collection type whose _iteration
       order_ is *NOT affected by* /transformations/, such as ~Seq~:
       ~numerals.toSeq map { _.symbol } foreach { sym => print(s"${sym} ") }~

       * cons:
         This usually comes at _the *cost* of an additional iteration_ over the
         original collection,

       * pros: 
         It's _easy_ and _straightforward_ to use.

   - *SUMMARY*
     If you are carrying out transformations on a collection, especially when
     chaining multiple operations, note that the iteration order of the original
     collection is *not automatically preserved*.

     Convert the original to a sequence if stable iteration order is required.

   The answer is 3:
   The first ~println~ statement throws a ~NullPointerException~, and the second
   prints: ~8~

   - The /default value/ of ~String~ is ~null~.
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala

     This can explain the result of ~println(s1.length)~.

   - _BAD_:
     In scala, you can use a variable before declaration like in Javascript.
     though you will see a *warning message*.

   - The Scala compiler *converts*
     _the concatenation of two string constants_ (here ~s2 + s2~ is equivalent
     to the source code ~(null: String) + (null: String)~)
     *into* bytecode equivalent to:

     + =From Jian=
       I add the ~:String~ part, and since the corresponding bytecodes does NOT
       have type info, they does NOT include the ~:String~ part. However, since
       we convert it to Scala source code, we need to modify it to fit the
       requirement of Scala compiler.

     The first invocation of invert3 fails to compile, and the second one
     prints:
     1, 2, 3

** Explanation
   It is very tricky!!!

   - The ~invert3~ definition will be converted to:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       def invert3 = new Function2[Int, Int, Unit] {
         def apply(v1: Int, v2: Int): Unit = invert(3)(v1, v2)
       }

       invert3.apply(v1 = 2) // Error
       invert3.apply(v1 = 2, v2 = 1)
     #+END_SRC

     =From Jian= The book is NOT clear!
     My understanding:
     1. According to the expanded version of the definition of ~invert3~,
        ~invert3.apply(v1 = 2, v2 = 1)~ is acutally ~invert(3)(2, 1)~.

     2. According to the definition of ~invert~, ~invert(3)(2, 1)~ is
        equivalent to ~invert(3)(v2 = 2, v1 = 1)~, where the order of ~v1~ and ~v2~
        is different from the ~v1~ and ~v2~ in ~invert3.apply(v1 = 2, v2 = 1)~.

        The two sets of ~v1~ and ~v2~ are differnnt, just an accident, though
        it leads to the wierd result. For ~Function2~, the parameters of its
        ~apply~ method is always ~v1~ and ~v2~ in order. Even if you use the other
        names in the definition of ~invert~, nothing will change!

        NO link between the names of the parameters of the definition of ~invert~,
        and the names of the parameters of the ~apply~ method.

** Discussion
   - Q :: Why do we need /curring/?

   - A :: 
     + Use the parameter(s) of a previous parameter list when defining /default
       arguments/:
       ~def area(x: Int)(y: Int = x) = x * y~

       =From Jian=
       According to this puzzler, I don't think this can be used?
       =I need Example= =TODO= =???= =!!!=

     + Facilitate type inference. =TODO= =Learn More=
       For example,
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         def foldLeft[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) => B): B
         // no need to specify `Int` for `B`
         Seq("I", "II", "III").foldLeft(0)(_ + _.length)
       #+END_SRC

     + Multiple parameter lists allow you to have *both* /implicit and non-implicit
       parameters/:
       ~def maxBy[B](f: A => B)(implicit cmp: Ordering[B]): A~

     + Simple DSL
       (use /curring/, /lazy parameter(s)/, and replace _parentheses_ with
       _curly braces_):
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         def benchmark(times: Int)(block: => Unit): Unit = ???

         benchmark(10000)  {
           // ...
         }
       #+END_SRC

     + Allow /partially applied functions/ to be expressed *concisely*.
       For example, if you define ~invert~ without /currying/, you *cannot*
       define ~invert3~ as ~def invert3 = invert(3) _~, and you must do
       ~def invert3 = invert(3, _: Int, _: Int)~.

       * You can also see the non-currying version *cannot* must be manually
         typed. The ONLY case you don't need the do this is when you pass an
         underscore for all arguments:
         ~def invert_ = invert(_, _, _)~

   - *SUMMARY*
     Bear in mind that when you are invoking a /partially applied function/,

     /named arguments/ do *not* resolve against the original method,
     *BUT* against a generated function object.

     =IMPORTANT=
     =From Jian= Anyway, this is a very tricky trap!!!!!!

     You can avoid problems by steering clear of parameter names used by Scala's
     function traits. =TODO= =How= =Create a sub-trait??? of Function2????=

     1. Names of implicits matter!
        + Importing an /implicit value/ of the *same name and type* as an existing
          implicit will *remove the existing implicit* from the set of applicable
          options considered by the compiler.

        + Importing an implicit of the *same type, but with a different name*, can
          lead to _"AMBIGUOUS implicit values"_ compiler errors.

     2. When defining a set of /implicits/ that are *intended to be overridable*,
        declare them in a _"default context" class or trait_ that *can be extended*.

        *Define overriding implicits in a subclass or subtrait of the default
        context.* In this case, higher priority implicits do not need to have
        the same name as the implicits they are intended to replace.

* DONE 35. A Listful of Dollars - 205
  CLOSED: [2018-08-24 Fri 20:01]
  The following program uses both of these features. What does it do?
  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    type Dollar = Int
    final val Dollar: Dollar = 1
    val x: List[Dollar] = List(1, 2, 3)

    println(x map { x: Int => Dollar })
    println(x.map(x: Int => Dollar))
  #+END_SRC

** Possibilities
   The first ~println~ statement prints:
   ~List(1, 1, 1)~
   and the second one throws

** Explanation
   For an anonymous function, The /block expression/ can be parsed differently,
   as opposed to being passed directly!

   - ~println(x map { x: Int => Dollar })~:
     it is equivalent to ~println(x map((x: Int) => Dollar))~. and its result is
     ~List(1, 1, 1)~, as expected.

   - ~println(x map(x: Int => Dollar))~:
     This can compile, but it has a run time error:
     ~java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: 3~

     This error message is a little tricky, but from it you know the ~x~ in
     ~x: Int => Dollar~ is NOT a /free variable/ that will be bound to ~List(1,
     2, 3)~'s elements. It is acutally the ~List(1, 2, 3)~.

     How this can happen?

     + ~List~'s in Scala are functions, which have non-static ~apply~ /method/.

     + Accidently, the ~apply~ /method/ of this list ~x~ is ~Int => Dollar~.
       By default, in the ~x.map(x: Int => Dollar)~, the ~x: Int => Dollar~ is
       interpreted as ~x: (Int => Dollar)~, rather than ~(x: Int) => Dollar~.
         Then the ~x~ here is considered as the list ~x~ (if you use other
       variable name, like ~y~, there will be a /compilation error/ of =not
       found: value y=), rather than a /free variable/.

       This is also why the ~IndexOutOfBoundsException: 3~ is there. The length
       of ~x~ is 3, and it doesn't have the 4th element, which index is ~3~.

** Discussion
   - You need parentheses if you doesn't mean ~x: (Int => Dollar)~.
     Use ~(x: Int) => Dollar~ or ~x => Dollar~, and here you can use other
     variable name besides ~x~.

   - *SUMMARY*
     - Be aware that
       passing an /anonymous function/ *in curly braces* actually creates a
       /block/.

     - /Anonymous functions/
       passed in a /block/
       *can be parsed differently* than when
       passed directly.

     - If you are passing an /anonymous, single-parameter function/ _in parentheses_,
       *make sure you enclose the parameter in parentheses if it has a type
       annotation.*

* DONE 36. Size It Up - 210
  CLOSED: [2018-08-18 Sat 21:09]
** Possibilities
** Explanation
   - ~Iterable~ does NOT have ~+~ /method/.
     When it is added to a string, the ~implicit final class any2stringadd[A] extends AnyVal~
     from ~Predef~ is applied.

** Discussion
   - Many want to remove ~any2stringadd~.
     This is likely to happen in future, although NOT necessarily in the short term.

   - Ways to solve this kind of problems:
     + /import selector/
       In the REPL, use ~:paste -raw~ (Entering past mode (ctrl-D to finish),
       and then the REPL will treats the subsequent input as a Scala file,
       rather than a script. Then use ~import Predef.{any2stringadd => _, _}~ --
       this means import all all the other things (the last ~_~), except
       ~any2stringadd~.

     + Create "ambiguous implicit values".
       In order for this to work, you need to introduce *not one, but TWO* new
       conversions.
         If you define only one implicit, it will be more specific than the
       conversion in ~Predef~ you want to disable and will be chosen instead,
       rather than producing the intended conflict:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         object NoAny2StringAdd {
           implicit val disableAny2stringadd1 = (_: Any) => ""
           implicit val disableAny2stringadd2 = (_: Any) => ""
         }

         import NoAny2StringAdd._
       #+END_SRC
       Then if a implicit conversion from ~Any~ to ~String~ is required, then
       the compiler will report the error!

     + The most straightforward way (!!!):
       specify the type *explicitly*.

       For example,
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         val healthierLunchbox: mutable.Iterable[String] =
           lunchbox + itemToAdd

         // error: type mismatch;
         //  found   : String
         //  required: scala.collection.mutable.Iterable[String]
         //            lunchbox + itemToAdd
         //                     ˆ
       #+END_SRC



   - *SUMMARY*
     Be aware that the Scala compiler can always fall back to treating the +
     operator as string concatenation if the argument is a string. If the
     expression is not intended to return a String , specify the expected result
     type explicitly. You can disable Predef.any2stringadd in your program to
     prevent the implicit conversion of any object to a string.
