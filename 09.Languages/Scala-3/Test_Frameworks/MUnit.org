* TODO Overview
** Getting started
*** Quick start
**** Run tests in sbt
**** Run tests in IntelliJ
**** Run tests in VS Code
**** Search for failed tests in CI logs
     
*** Usage guide
*** Why JUnit?
*** Why not just JUnit?
*** Stability
*** Inspirations 
    
** Declaring tests
*** Declare basic test
*** Declare async test
*** Customize test timeouts
*** Run tests in parallel
*** Declare tests inside a helper function
*** Declare test that should always fail
*** Customize evaluation of tests with tags
*** Customize test name based on a dynamic condition
*** Tag flaky tests
*** Run logic before and after tests
*** Share configuration between test suites 

** Writing assertions
*** ~assert()~
*** ~assertEquals()~
*** ~assertNotEquals()~
*** ~assertNoDiff()~
*** ~intercept()~
*** ~interceptMessage()~
*** ~fail()~
*** ~compileErrors()~

** Using fixtures
*** Functional test-local fixtures
*** Reusable test-local fixtures
*** Reusable suite-local fixtures
*** Ad-hoc test-local fixtures
*** Ad-hoc suite-local fixtures
*** Asynchronous fixtures with ~FutureFixture~
*** Asynchronous fixtures with custom effect type
*** Avoid stateful operations in the class constructor  
   
** Filtering tests
*** Run only a single test case
*** Ignore single test case
*** Ignore single test case based on a dynamic conditions
*** Ignore entire test suite
*** Ignore entire test suite based on a dynamic condition
*** Include and exclude tests based on tags
*** Include and exclude tags by default when running sbt ~test~
*** Group test suites with categories
*** Filter tests cases based on a dynamic conditions  
   
** Coming from ScalaTest
*** Converting Suite Structure
*** Converting Assertions

** Troubleshooting
*** Print full stack traces
*** Invalid test class  
   
* TODO Integrations
** ScalaCheck
*** Getting started
*** Using assertions
*** Configuring ScalaCheck
*** Reproducing a property failure
*** Migrating from ScalaTest
*** Porting existing ScalaCheck ~Properties~

** External Integrations
