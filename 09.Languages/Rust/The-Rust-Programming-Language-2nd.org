*** DONE Anatomy of a Rust Program - 5
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 01:39]
    - rustfmt

    - It's good style to place the _opening curly bracket_ *on the same line* as
      the function declaration, adding one space in between.

    - ~println!~ is a /Rust macro/.
      =TODO= Discuss Rust macros in more details in Appendix E.
      ~!~ means you're calling a macro instead of a normal function.

    - There are four important details to notice here:
      1. Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.

      2. ~println!~ is a /Rust macro/.
         It will be discussed in Chapter 19.

      3. You see the ~"Hello, world!"~ string. We pass this string as an argument
         to ~println!~, and the string is printed to the screen.

      4. End the line with a semicolon (~;~), which indicates that this expression
         is over and the next one is ready to begin.
         =TODO= Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon.
         =from Jian= Why _MOST_???

*** DONE Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps - 6
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 01:39]
    The command is mentioned in the _Writing and Running a Rust Program_ section.

    - ~rustc main.rs~

    - In Linux and macOS,
      =main= and =main.rs=

    - In Windows,
      =main.exe=, =main.pdb=, and =main.rs=
      * =main.pdb= is a file containing debugging information

    - Just compiling with =rustc= is fine for simple programs,
      but as your project grows, you'll want to manage all the options and make
      it easy to share your code.
      * Next, we'll introduce you to the _Cargo tool_, which will help you write
        real-world Rust programs.

** DONE Hello, Cargo! - 7
   CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 15:53]
   Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager.

   - Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo
     handles a lot of tasks for you, such as
     * building your code,
     * downloading the libraries your code depends on, and
     * building those libraries. (We call libraries your code needs dependencies.)

   - If you installed Rust with the given command (Section 1.1)
     ~$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh~, *Cargo* should have been installed.
     * Use ~cargo --version~ to check if it is installed properly.

*** DONE Creating a Project with Cargo - 8
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 15:53]
    ~cargo new hello_cargo --bin~
    - ~--bin~ argument (to ~cargo new~):
      make an _executable application_, as opposed to a _library_.

    - The new project contains three files:
      * =Cargo.toml=: a structured plain text file.
      * =src= folder
      * =.gitignore= file and =.git= folder
        + This won't be generated if you run =cargo new= within an existing Git repository
        + Override this behavior by using
          =cargo new --vcs=some-vcs-system=, or
          =cargo new --vcs some-vcs-system=.
          - Current (1.51.0-nightly) [possible values: fossil, git, hg, none, pijul]

    - This simple =Cargo.toml= file:
      #+begin_src toml
        [package]
        name = "hello_cargo"
        version = "0.1.0"
        authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
        edition = "2018"

        [dependencies]
      #+end_src
      This file is the *TOML* (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format.
      *TOML* is similar to *INI* but has some extra goodies and is used as
      Cargo's configuration format.
      * ~[package]~ is a section heading that indicates that the following
        statements are configuring a /package/.
        + The next four lines set the _configuration information Cargo needs to
          compile your program_:
          - the name,
          - the version,
          - who wrote it, and
          - the edition of Rust to use.

          Cargo gets your name and email information from your environment, so
          if that information is not correct, fix the information now and then
          save the file. =from Jian= From where???
          =TODO= We'll talk about the edition key in _Appendix E_.

      * =TODO= =SIMPLIFY NOTE=
        ~[dependencies]~ is the start of a section for you to list any of your
        project's dependencies.
        + In Rust, packages of code are referred to as /crates/.

    - The =src/main.rs= file is initialized as a simple _hello world_ program.

    - Cargo EXPECTS your source files to live *INSIDE* the =src= directory.

    - The top-level project directory is just for
      * =READMEs=
      * license info
      * configuration files
      * anything else not related to your code

    - Using Cargo helps you organize your projects.
      There's a place for everything, and everything is in its place.

*** DONE Building and Running a Cargo Project - 9
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 15:53]
    - Build:
      ~$ cargo build~

      The output:
      #+begin_src text
        Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
         Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs
      #+end_src

    - This should have created an executable file in =target/debug/hello_cargo=.

    - Manually Run (just a try, not recommended):
      ~$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo~

      The output:
      ="Hello, world!"=

    - The first time you run ~cargo build~ in a project, a =Cargo.lock= file
      will be added in the top level of this project.
      #+begin_src toml
        [root]
        name = "hello_cargo"
        version = "0.1.0"
      #+end_src

    - Run:
      ~$ cargo run~
      * The output:
        #+begin_src text
             Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (/home/shapeless-cat/Practices/hello_cargo)
              Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s
               Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
          Hello, world!
        #+end_src

    - Cargo also provides a command called ~cargo check~.
      This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t
      produce an executable:
      ~$ cargo check~
      The output:
      #+begin_src text
        Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
         Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
      #+end_src

    - Q :: Why would you not want an executable?
    - A :: Often, ~cargo check~ is much faster than ~cargo build~,
           because it *skips the step of producing an executable.*
      * Many Rustaceans run ~cargo check~ periodically as they write their program
        to make sure it compiles.
          Then they run ~cargo build~ when they're ready to use the executable.

    - Let's recap what we've learned so far about Cargo:
      * We can build a project using ~cargo build~.

      * We can build and run a project in one step using ~cargo run~.

      * We can build a project *without producing a binary* to check for errors
        using ~cargo check~.

      * Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our
        code, Cargo stores it in the =target/debug= directory.

    - An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no
      matter which operating system you're working on.

*** DONE Building for Release - 10
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 15:53]
    When your project is finally ready for release, you can use
    ~cargo build --release~ to compile it with optimizations.

    - This command will create an executable in =target/release= instead of
      =target/debug=.

    - The optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on
      lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile.

    - This is why there are _TWO_ different profiles:
      * _one for development_, when you want to *rebuild quickly and often*, and
      * another for building the final program you'll give to a user that won't
        be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible.

    - If you're _benchmarking_ your code's running time,
      be sure to run ~cargo build --release~ and benchmark with the executable
      in =target/release=.

*** DONE Cargo as Convention - 11

  CLOSED: [2021-01-02 Sat 01:26]
  Generate a random integer between 1 and 100.
  Try to guess.
  The program tells you if it is right, too low, or to high?
  If not right keep guessing.
  If right print congratulations and exit.

** DONE Setting Up a New Project - 14

       name = "guessing_game"
       version = "0.1.0"
       author = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
       edition = "2018"

     correct, fix that in the file and save it again.

     use std::io;

     fn main() {
         println!("Guess the number!");

         println!("Please input your guess.");

         let mut guess = String::new();

         io::stdin()
             .read_line(&mut guess)

   - ~std~ means the standard library.
     ~io~ library comes from the standard library.

   - Use ~use~ when the required libraries are not in the /prelude/.

   - This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input
     from the user.

*** Storing Values with Variables - 15
    - ~String~ is a /string type/ provided by the /standard library/ that is a
      growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.

      * The ~::~ syntax in the ~::new~ line indicates that new is an /associated
        function/ of the ~String~ type.

        + /an associated function/ ::
          a function that is implemented *on a /type/,* in this case ~String~,
          _rather than on a particular instance_ of a ~String~ (Some languages
          call this a /static method/).

      * ~String::new()~ create a _NEW, EMPTY string._

      * TO SUMMARIZE,
        the ~let mut guess = String::new();~ line has *created* a
        /mutable variable/ that is currently bound to a NEW, EMPTY /instance/ of
        a ~String~.

    - ~io::stdin~ should be written as ~std::io::stdin~ if you did NOT
      ~use std::io~.

    - The job of ~read_line~ is to
      1. take whatever the user types into standard input
         and
      2. place that into a /string/, so it takes that string as an argument.

    - The /string argument/ of ~read_line~, ~guess~,
      needs to be /mutable/
      so the /method/ can change the _string's content_ by adding the user input.

    - The ~&~ indicates that this argument is a /reference/, which gives you a way
      to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data _without_ needing
      to copy that data into memory multiple times.

    - /References/ are a COMPLEX feature, and one of Rust's major advantages is
      how safe and easy it is to use /references/.
      * /references/ are *immutable* BY DEFAULT.
        Hence, you need to write ~&mut guess~ rather than ~&guess~ to make it /mutable/.
        =TODO= (Chapter 4 will explain references more thoroughly.)

*** Handling Potential Failure with the ~Result~ Type - 17
    - ~read_line~ also returns a value -- an ~io::Result~ typed value.

    - Rust has a number of /types/ named ~Result~ in its standard library:
      * a generic ~Rusult~
      * a specific versions for submodules, such as ~io::Result~.

    - The ~Result~ types are /enumerations/, often referred to as ~enums~.
        An enumeration is a type that can have a _fixed_ set of values, and those
      values are called the /enum's variants/.
      =TODO= CHAPTER 6

    - For ~Result~, the /variants/ are ~Ok~ or ~Err~.
      * ~Ok~ indicates the operation was successful, and it contains the success-
        fully generated value.

      * ~Err~ indicates the operation was failed, and it contains info about
        _how_ and _why_ the operation failed.

    - ~io::Result~ has an ~expect~ method that you can call.
      * With an ~Err~ value, ~expect~ will cause the program to crash and
        display the message that you passed as an argument to ~expect~.

      * With an ~Ok~ value, ~expect~ will take the return value that ~Ok~ is
        holding and return just the value to you.

    - If you have a ~Result~ type value, and you don't use ~expect~ method or try
      to catch the error (=TODO= CHAPTER 9), The compiler will issue a warning
      becuase of _unused value_ issue.

    - =TODO=
      Chapter 9 will show how to recover from errors.

** DONE Generating a Secret Number - 19
   CLOSED: [2021-01-02 Sat 01:24]
   Not random number functionality in /standard library/, however, the Rust team
   does provide a =rand= /create/.

*** DONE Using a Crate to Get More Functionality - 19
    CLOSED: [2021-01-02 Sat 01:24]
     - /crate/ is a collection of Rust source code files.

       * The project we've been building is a /binary crate/, which is an
         executable.

       * The =rand= /crate/ is a /library crate/, which contains code intended to be
         used in other programs.

     - To use a crate in a Rust project, we need to modify the =Cargo.toml= -- add
       a /dependency/:
       #+begin_src toml
         [dependencies]
         rand = "0.5.5"
       #+end_src

     - Cargo understand [[http://semver.org][Semantic Versioning]] (/SemVer/ for short), which is a
       standard for writing version numbers.
       * The =0.5.5= is a _shorthand_ for =^0.5.5=, which means
         "any version that has a public API compatible with version =0.5.5=".

**** Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the =Cargo.lock= File
     The first time you run ~$ cargo build~ (or ~$cargo run~) Cargo tries to
     figure out the versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then
     writes them to the =Cargo.lock= file.

     When you build in the future, Cargo will read =Cargo.lock= rather then tries
     to figure out the verions of dependencies again through parsing =Cargo.toml=.

     _Remember_: the acutally used versions of dependencies (info is in
     =Cargo.lock=) are different from the ones written in =Cargo.toml= -- Cargo
     may choose a higher but can fit version.

**** Updating a Crate to Get a New Version
     - ~$ cargo update~ will help you to update the dependencies to the lastest
       fit version. For instance, 0.5.5 to 0.5.6.

     - If the *first time* you run ~$ cargo build~ it used version _0.5.5_, the
       later ~$ cargo update~ will choose version _exclusively_ between _0.5.5_
       and _0.6.0_.

     - If you want a higher version, like _0.6.0_, you must manually update the
       =Cargo.toml= file.

** DONE Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number - 23

   - ~Ordering~ is a type, and it has three variants:
     ~Less~, ~Greater~, and ~Equal~.

   - A ~match~ expression is made up of /arms/.

   - An /arm/ consists of a /pattern/ and the code that should be run when
     pattern matching can be applied.

   - The code above CANNOT be compiled -- type mismatching:
     ~guess~ should be a number if we want to compare it with ~secret_number~.

   - Integer types: ~i32~, ~u32~, ~i64~.
     Rust defaults to an ~i32~, which is the type of ~secret_number~.
     Here, ~u32~ is more reasonable.

** DONE Summary - 30

* DONE 3. Common Programming Concepts - 31
  CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 03:16]
  This chapter covers *concepts* that APPEAR IN ALMOST EVERY programming language
  and how they work in Rust.
    Many programming languages have much in common at their core. _NONE of the
  concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust_, but we'll _discuss them
  in the context_ of Rust and explain the conventions around using these concepts.

  - Specifically, you'll learn about
    * variables
    * basic types
    * functions
    * comments
    * control flow

    These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning them early
    will give you a strong core to start from.

  - *Keywords* See Appendix A =TODO=

** DONE Variables and Mutability - 32
   CLOSED: [2021-01-02 Sat 14:02]
*** DONE Differences Between Variables and Constants - 34
    CLOSED: [2021-01-02 Sat 13:54]
    - Rust has ~const~ keyword.

    - /Constants/ *must be* /immutable/.

    - The /type/ of /constant/ (declared with ~const~) *must be* annotated.

    - /Constants/ can be declared in any /scope/, including the /global scope/.

    - A /constant/ can ONLY be set to a /constant expression/,
      (=from Jian= I use *ONLY* here, and WHY does this book use *may be*???)
      NOT
      * the result of a function call
        or
      * any other value that could only be computed at runtime.

    - Example:
      #+begin_src rust
        const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
      #+end_src

    - /Constants/ are *valid*
      * for the entire time a program runs,
      * within the scope they were declared in,

      making them a useful choice for values in your application domain that
      multiple parts of the program might need to know about

    - Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as /constants/ is useful
      in _conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code._

*** DONE Shadowing - 34
    CLOSED: [2021-01-02 Sat 14:02]
    _I think the /shadowing/ feature is BAD._

    - Shadowing is different from ~mut~.
      * It actually create a new variable (~mut~ or not).
        Since it is NEW, it can have a DIFFERENT /type/.

    =From Jian=
    From my point of view, the only natural way of shadowing is in embeded scope.
    I don't want to see shadowing happend in a flat structure, though it is actually
    a new scope -- start from the point that the shadowing happens.

** DONE Data Types - 36
   CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 01:59]
   Look at two data type subsets: /scalar/ and /compound/.

*** DONE Scalar Types - 36
    CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 00:32]
    - /scala type/ :: A type represents a single value.

    - _FOUR_ primary /scalar types/ in Rust:
      + integers
      + floating-point numbers
      + Booleans
      + characters

**** DONE Integer Types
     CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 00:32]
     - integer :: a number WITHOUT a fractional component.

     - Each variant can be either /signed/ or /unsigned/ and has an explicit size.

     - Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust
       | Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
       |---------+--------+----------|
       | 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
       | 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
       | 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
       | 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
       | 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
       | arch    | isize  | usize    |

     - Each signed variant range: -(2 ^ (n-1)) to (2 ^ (n-1)) - 1 inclusive.

     - Each unsigned variant can store numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1

     - Signed numbers are stored using /two's complement/ representation.

     - ~isize~ and ~usize~ depend on the architectures:
       32-bit for 32-bit architecture;
       64-bit for 64-bit architecture.

     - All number literals _except the byte literal_ allow a /type suffix/, for
       example: ~57u8~

     - ~_~ as a visual separator, such as ~1_000~. You can put the ~_~ anywhere
       in numbers.

     - Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust
       | Number literals | Example       |
       |-----------------+---------------|
       | Decimal         | ~98\under222~      |
       | Hex             | ~0xff~        |
       | Octal           | ~0o77~        |
       | Binary          | ~0b1111\under0000~ |
       | Byte(~u8~ only) | ~b'A'~        |

     - If you don't know which type of integer to use,
       use the default ~i32~. _It is generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems._

     - The primary situation in which you'd use ~isize~ or ~usize~ is when
       indexing some sort of collection.
       =From Jian= This sounds like the ~size_t~ type in C.

     - *Integer Overflow*
       - Compile in *debug mode*,
         Rust includes checks for /integer overflow/ that cause your program to
         panic at runtime if this behavior occurs.
         * =TODO= "Unrecoverable Errors with panic!" section in Chapter 9.

       - Compile in *release mode* with the ~--release~ flag,
         1. Rust does _not include checks_ for /integer overflow/ that cause
            /panics/.
         2. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs /two's complement wrapping/.
            * The program won't /panic/,
              BUT the variable will have a value that probably isn't what you
              were expecting it to have.

            * *Relying on integer overflow's wrapping behavior is considered an error.*
              If you want to _wrap EXPLICITLY_, you can use the /standard library
              type/ ~Wrapping~.

**** DONE Floating-Point Types
     CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 00:32]
     ~f32~ (IEEE-754 single-precision) and ~f64~ (IEEE-754 double-precision).

     - *By default* the /floating type/ is ~f64~
       because
       on modern CPUs it's *roughly the same speed* as ~f32~
       but is capable of _more precision_.

     - Example:
       #+begin_src rust
         fn main() {
             let x = 2.0; // f64
             let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
         }

**** DONE The Character Type
     CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 00:32]
     In Rust, ~char~ type values are /Unicode Scalar Values/.
     Range: from =U+0000= to =U+D7FF= and =U+E000= to =U+10FFFF= inclusive.

     - However, a "character" is NOT really a concept in Unicode, so your human
       intuition for what a "charactr" is may NOT match up with what a ~char~ is
       in Rust.
       =TODO=

     CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 01:15]
    - ~let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);~

        ~let (x, y, z) = tup;~

      * ~.~ syntax
        ~tup.0~ is ~500~.

**** DONE The Array Type
     CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 01:59]
     Rust /arrays/ have a fixed length: once declared, they CANNOT grow or shrink
     in size.
     ~let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];~

     - /Arrays/ are useful
       * when you want your data allocated on the /stack/ _rather than_ the
         /heap/ (=TODO= we will discuss the /stack/ and the /heap/ more in
         Chapter 4),
         or
       * when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements.

     - /Arrays/ are not as flexible as /vectors/.
       If you're unsure whether to use an /array/ or a /vector/, you should probably
       use a /vector/.
       =TODO= Chapter 8 discusses /vectors/ in more detail.

     - Create an array that contains the _same_ value for EACH element:
       ~let a = [3; 5];~

***** DONE Accessing Array Elements
      CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 01:59]
      An /array/ is a SINGLE chunk of memory allocated on the /stack/.

      - Acces elements of an /array/ using /indexing/, ~a[0]~.

***** DONE Invalid Array Element Access
      CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 01:59]
      - When this happens,
        Generally speaking, compilation wouldn't produce any errors,
        * BUT when the index info can be known at compile time, errors can be
          reported.

        * When the index info is unknown at compile time (most cases), Rust will
          /panic/ at runtime.

      - /panic/ :: a program exits with an error.

      - =TODO= Chapter 9 error handling.

      - In many low-level languages, such as C, this kind of check is NOT done.

** DONE Functions - 43
   CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 02:30]
   - Rust function name convention: /snake case/.

   - /snake case/: all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.

*** DONE Function Parameters - 44
    CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 02:04]
    - Technically, the concrete values are called /arguments/.

    - In casual conversation people tend to use the words "parameter" and
      "argument" interchangeably.

    - In /function signatures/, you *must* declare the /type/ of EACH /parameter/.

    - Example:
      #+begin_src rust
        // src/main.rs
        fn main() {
            another_function(5, 6);
        }

        fun another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
            println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
            println!("The vlaue of y is: {}", y);
        }
      #+end_src

*** DONE Function Bodies Contain Statements and Expressions - 45
    CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 02:24]
    - /Function bodies/ are made up of a series of /statements/ OPTIONALLY ENDING
      in an /expressions/.

    - Because Rust is an /expression-based language/,
      the distinction between /statements/ and /expressions/ is IMPORTANT.

    - /statements/ :: instructions that perform some action and do not return a
                      value.

    - /expressions/ :: evaluate to a resulting value.

    - Calling a _function_ is an expression.

    - Calling a _macro_ is an expression.

    - =IMPORTANT=
      Different from many other languages, a /Rust statement/ does *NOT* have
      /return value/.

         However, this pattern is so common that Rust has a built-in language
       construct for it. This pattern is eliminate a lot of nesting that would

* DONE 4. Understanding Ownership - 59
  CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 15:51]
  /ownership/ is the *MOST UNIQUE feature* of Rust,
  and
  it enables Rust to make
  /memory safety/ guarantees _without_ needing a /garbage collector/.

  This chapter will talk about several related features:
  - /ownership/
  - /borrowing/
  - /slice/
  - how Rust lays data out in memory.

** DONE What is Ownership? - 59
   CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 03:27]
   - ~ownership~ is the central feature of Rust.

   - _Most languages_ can be grouped to _TWO_ categories
     if considering _the ways they manage memory_:
     + With garbage collector
     + Explicitly call _allocate_ and _deallocate (free)_ operations to manage
       the memory.

   - HOWEVER,
     Rust is different from these two categories -- it has its own approach to
     manage memory:
       Memory is managed through a system of /ownership/ with a set of rules that
     the compiler checks at compile time.
     * _NO run-time costs_ are incurred for ANY of the /ownership/ features.

   - =TODO=
     This chapter we work through some examples to learn how /ownership/
     works. The examples focus on a very common data structure:
     *strings*.

   - *The Stack and the Heap*
     - In a systems programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the
       /stack/ or the /heap/ has _more of an effect on_
       * HOW the language behaves
       * WHY we have to make certain decision.

     - Here is a brief explanation in preparation
       (We'll describe parts of /ownership/ in relation to the /stack/ and the
        /heap/ _later_ in this chapter).

       * Both the /stack/ and the /heap/ are parts of /memory/ that is available
         to your code _at runtime_.

       * /stack/ -- LIFO.
         /push on to/ and /pop off/

       * Use the data in /stack/ is fast:
         + no need to search (top frame(s))
         + fixed size

       * The process of get space from /heap/ is called /allocating on the heap/.

       * /pointers/ (rather than the data it points to, some of which can be
         fixed size but not all) are known and have *fixed size*. They can be
         stored on the /stack/.

       * Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the /heap/,
         _minimizing the amount of duplicate data_ on the /heap/,
         and /cleaning up/ unused data on the /heap/ so we don't run out of space
         are all problems that /ownership/ addresses.
         =IMPORTANT=

         Once you understand /ownership/, you won't need to think about the /stack/
         and the /heap/ very often, but knowing that managing /heap/ data is why
         /ownership/ exists can help explain why it works the way it does.

*** DONE Ownership Rules - 61
    CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 03:31]
    =FIXME= ordered list

    1. _EACH_ value in Rust has a variable that's called its /owner/.
       (/owner/ is one variable)

    2. There can ONLY be ONE /owner/ at a time.

    3. When the /owner/ goes _out of /scope/,_ the value will be *dropped*.

*** DONE Variable Scope - 61
    CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 03:31]
    As in C/C++, the boundaries of a /scope/ is marked with a pair of curly braces.

    =NEXT= Now we'll build on top of this understanding by introducing the ~String~ type.

*** DONE The ~String~ Type - 62
    CLOSED: [2021-01-03 Sun 03:40]
    To illustrate the rules of /ownership/, we need data that stored on the
    /heap/. The data type we mentioned in Chapter 3 are all stored on the
    /stack/ (they will be popped off the /stack/ when their scope is over, NO
    need for /ownership/).

    - /String literals/ are NOT enough.
      /String literals/ are *immutable*, and they have *known size* (of course,
      "literal" indicates they are _hard coded_, and _hard coded_ things are
      ALWAYS of known sizes).

      * Q :: What if we want _immutable_, and _unknow size_ space to store a
             sequence of characters?
      * A :: Then we need ~String~ variables.
             Another /string type/ provided by Rust.
               This type is allocated on the /heap/ and as such is able to store
             an amount of text that is _unknown to us at /compile time/._

    - WHY ~String~ CAN be mutated but literals CANNOT?
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
        s.push_str(", world!");
        println!("{}", s);  // This will print "hello, world!"
      #+END_SRC

      _The difference is how these two types deal with memory._

    - The ~::~ syntax will be discussed more
      in "Method Syntax" section of _Chapter 5_ and
      when we talk about namespacing with modules in
      "Paths for Referring to an item in the Module Tree" in _Chapter 7_.

*** DONE Memory and Allocation - 63
    CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 03:20]
    - Q :: WHY /string literals/ are immutable?
    - A :: All the info about /string literals/ are fixed, they are hardcoded
           directly into the final executable (saved in the /stack/), _making
           /string literals/ *fast* and *efficient*._
      * These properties only come from its /immutability/.

    - With the ~String~ /type/,
      IN ORDER TO support a /mutable/, /growable/ piece of text,
      we need to *allocate* an amount of /memory/ on the /heap/:
      * allocation :: The /memory/ must be requested from the operating system
                      _at runtime_.

      * /deallocation/ :: We need a way of *returning* this /memory/ to the operating
                          system when we're done with our ~String~.

    - /allocation/ is done when we call ~String::from~.
      This is pretty much universal in programming languages.

    - /deallocation/ is different in different languages.
      + Some languages use GC.

      + Without GC, it is usually hard
        * if we forget, we'll waste memory -- _memory leak_.

        * if we do it too early, we'll have an invalid variable. =TODO= segFault???

        * if we do it twice (or more), that's a bug too.

    - We need to _PAIR_
      *exactly one* ~allocate~ with *exactly one* ~free~.

    - Rust does NOT use GC, but it also takes a different path from the tradition
      way of explicitly using /allocation/ and /deallocation/:
        the /memory/ is AUTOMATICALLY returned once the variable that owns it goes
      _out of /scope/._
      * Rust *automatically* calls the special function ~drop~ and *implicitly* at
        the closing ~}~.

    - Note: =TODO= =LEARN from C++=
      In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item's
      /lifetime/ is sometimes called /Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)/.
        The ~drop~ function in Rust will be familiar to you if you've used RAII
      patterns in C++.

    - =IMPORTANT=
      The Rust way _seems simple_,
      BUT it can be _unexpected in more complicated situations_
      when we want to have multiple variables use the data we've allocated on
      the /heap/.

**** DONE Ways Variables and Data Interact: /Move/
     CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 03:07]
     #+BEGIN_SRC rust
       let s1 = String::from("hello");
       let s2 = s1;
     #+END_SRC

     - A ~String~ basic info is made up of three parts:
       * a /pointer/ to the (/heap/) memory that _holds_ the contents of the string
       * a /length/
       * a /capacity/

       This group of data is stored on the /stack/.

     - /length/ :: how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the ~String~ is
                   currently using.

     - /capacity/ :: the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the ~String~ has
                     received from the OS.

     - When we _assign_ ~s1~ to ~s2~, the ~String~ info data is copied, meaning
       we copy the /pointer/, the /length/, and the /capacity/ that are on the
       /stack/.

       _We do *NOT copy* the data on the /heap/ that the /pointer/ refers to._

     - For the discussion about the above example till now,
       if ~drop~ is naive, there will be a /double free error/, and it is one of
       the memory safety bugs.
       * Rust does one extra thing, it invalidate ~s1~ after ~s2 = s1;~.

     - /move/ :: when do operations like assignment,
       1. copy the meta info of this varaible (/pointer/ combined with other info)
          that is on /stack/;
       2. invalidate the old one on /stack/.

     - CAUTION:
       Here we discuss /move/, which is unrelated to the stack-only data.

     - The step 1 in /move/ is just like the "shallow copy", a concept we learn
       in almost all languages,
       BUT now we also have the step 2, that's why we have this new concept /move/.

     - In addition, there’s a design choice that's implied by this:
       * Rust will _NEVER automatically_ create “deep” copies of your data.

       Therefore, in Rust, any _automatic copying_ can be assumed to be
       *inexpensive* in terms of runtime performance.

**** DONE Ways Variables and Data Interact: /Clone/
     CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 03:10]
     If you do want to *copy the heap data* of a an object,
     like the ~String~ in the above example:
     #+BEGIN_SRC rust
       let s1 = String::from("hello");
       let s2 = s1.clone();

       println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
     #+END_SRC

     - This is called /clone/, which might be _expensive_ -- the implementation of
       ~clone~ can be arbitrary code.

     - ~clone~ is a visual indicator that something different is going on.

**** DONE Stack-Only Data: /Copy/
     CLOSED: [2021-01-04 Mon 03:20]
     #+BEGIN_SRC rust
       let x = 5;
       let y = x;

       println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
     #+END_SRC

     - No compile error, ~x~ is still valid in the ~println!~ line.

     - Values of types like integer are stored on /stack/.
       Copy a value in /stack/ is *NOT expensive* (even in the /move/ operation,
       we copy the data in /stack/ which is cheap, we just DID NOT copy the data
       in /heap/ which can be expensive).
       Thus, NO reason to prevent ~x~ from being valid after we create ~y~.

     - ~Copy~ trait:
       * If a type has the ~Copy~ trait, an older variable is still valid after
         assignment.

       * Rust WON'T let us annotate a type with the ~Copy~ /trait/ if the type,
         or any of its parts, has implemented the ~Drop~ /trait/ -- the
         _exclusive property_ between the ~Copy~ /trait/ and the ~Drop~ /trait/.

       * If
         1. a type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope
         2. we add ~Copy~ annotation to that /type/, we'll get a /compile time error/.

         =TODO= see Appendix C on _Derivable Traits_ to learn about how to add the
         ~Copy~ annotation to your type.

     - As a general rule, any group of _simple_ /scalar values/ can be ~Copy~.
       =from Jian=
       See below, the /tuples/ case, you will know what does this _simple_ mean.

     - Examples of the types that are ~Copy~:
       * All integer types
       * The boolean type
       * All floating point types
       * Tuples, but ONLY if they contain types that are also ~Copy~:
         Values of type ~(i32, i32)~ are ~Copy~.
         Values of type ~(i32, String)~ are _NOT_.

                                                     // moves out to the calling
                                                     // function

        fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                              // scope

            a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
        }
      #+end_src

    - If we pass the value of a variable into a function and we still want to use
      this value after this call, we can return this value back:
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        fn main() {
            let s1 = String::from("hello");

            let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

            println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
        }

        fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
            let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String.

            (s, length)
        }
      #+END_SRC
      *However, this is tedious.
      Luckily for us, Rust has a feature called /references/.*

** DONE References & Borrowing - 70
   CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 00:10]
   The last example of the last section, with the help of /reference/:
   #+begin_src rust
     fn main() {
         let s1 = String::from("hello");
         let len = calculate_length(&s1);
         println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
     }

     fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
         s.len()
     }
   #+end_src

   - These _ampersands_ above are /references/.

   - *NOTE*:
     The opposite of referencing by using ~&~ is /dereferencing/, which is
     accomplished with the /dereference operator/, ~*~.
     =TODO=
     We'll see _some uses of the /dereference operator/ in Chapter 8_ and
     _discuss details of /dereferencing/ in Chapter 15._

   - A /reference/ is essentially a pointer points to the basic info data (a
     pointer, string length, and its capacity) of ~s1~.

   - The name /reference/ indicates _NOT OWN_.
     NO ~drop~ will be applied to the data it refers to when ~s~ goes out of
     scope.
       On the other hand, since /pointers/ are on /stack/, they will be poped
     out automatically.

   - We call _having references as function parameters_ /borrowing/ -- when it's
     done, give it back.

   - If you try to _MODIFY_ the /borrowed value/, the compiler will issue an error
     =error: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content `*some_string` as mutable=
     Just as variables are _immutable BY DEFAULT_, so are /references/.

    =IMPORATN=
    ONE big _restriction_ to /mutable references/:
    you can ONLY have _one_ /mutable reference/ to a particular piece of data
    _in a particular scope_.

    - Example of fail (CANNOT be compiled):
      =error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time=
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        let mut s = String::from("hello");

        let r1 = &mut s;
        let r2 = &mut s;
      #+END_SRC

    - This restriction _allows for mutation BUT in a very controlled fashion_.
      * PROS: Rust can prevent /data races/ at compile time
      * CONS: new Rustaceans struggle with this restrictin -- NOT a real cons

    - A /data race/ is a particular type of race condition in which these _THREE_
      behaviors occur:
      1. Two or more /pointers/ access the same data at the same time.
      2. At least one of the /pointers/ is being used to write to the data.
      3. There's NO mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

    - /Data races/ cause /undefined behavior/ and can be difficult to diagnose
      and fix when you're trying to track them down at runtime;
        Rust prevents this problem from happening because it won't even compile
      code with data races!

    - As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for
      multiple mutable references, just NOT simultaneous ones:
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        let mut s = String::from("hello");

        {
            let r1 = &mut s;
        } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

        let r2 = &mut s;
      #+END_SRC

    - A similar rule exists for combining mutable and immutable references.
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        let mut s = String::from("hello");

        let r1 = &s;  // NO problem
        let r2 = &s;  // NO problem
        let r3 = &mut s;  // BIG PROBLEM
      #+END_SRC
      With compile the error:
      =error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable=

    - Some conclusions:
      * _A_ /mutable reference/ is EXCLUSIVE with the other /references/ (both
        mutable or immutable).

      * Any /immutable reference/ are compatible with the other /immutable
        references/.
          This is reasonable. Users of an _immutable references_ don't expect
        the value to suddenly change out from under them.

      * On the other hand, ONLY multiple /immutable references/ is ok.

    - Note that
      a /reference/'s /scope/ starts from where it is introduced and continues
      through the LAST time that /reference/ is used.
      #+begin_src rust
        let mut s = String::from("hello");

        let r1 = &s;  // no problem
        let r2 = &s;  // no problem
        println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
        // r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

        let r3 = &mut s;  // no problem
        println!("{}", r3);
      #+end_src
      =IMPORTANT=
      The /scopes/ of the /immutable references/ ~r1~ and ~r2~ end after the
      ~println!~ _where they are LAST used_, which is BEFORE the /mutable reference/
      ~r3~ is created. *These scopes _don't overlap_, so this code is allowed.*

*** DONE Dangling References - 74
    CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 00:10]
    - In languages with /pointers/, it's easy to erroneously create a /dangling
      pointer/.

    - /a dangling pointer/ ::
      a /pointer/ that /references/ a location in memory that may have been given to
      someone else, by _freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that
      memory._

    - In Rust, by contrast, the compiler *guarantees* that /references/ will never
      be /dangling references/:
      if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the
      data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

    1. At ANY given time, you can have _either but NOT both_ of:
       * *One* /mutable reference/.
       * *Any number* of /immutable references/.

    2. /References/ *must always* be valid.

    Next, we'll look at a different kind of /reference/: /slices/.

** DONE The Slice Type - 75
   CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 15:46]
   - Another data type that does _NOT_ have /ownership/ is the /slice/.

   - /slices/ let you *reference* a /contiguous sequence of elements/
     in a collection rather than the whole collection.

   - Let's use a example to illustrate this:
     * Q ::
       WRITE a /function/ that
       TAKES a /string/ and
       RETURNS the _first word_ it finds in that /string/.
               If no space can be found, return the whole string.

     * A :: The signature should be like ~fn first_word(s: &String) -> ?~.
            We don't want /ownership/, so this is fine.

     * Q :: BUT what should we return?
       1. Since we don't have the /ownership/,
          we don't really have a way to talk about part of a /string/.

       2. However, we could _return the /index/ of the end of the word._
          Let's try that, as shown in Listing 4-7.
          #+begin_src rust
            fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
                let bytes = s.as_bytes();

                for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
                    if item == b' ' {
                        return i;
                    }
                }

                s.len()
            }
          #+end_src
          + =TODO= We'll discuss /iterators/ in more detail in Chapter 13.

          + Since the returned value of ~usize~ is a separate value from the
            ~String~, there's no guarantee that it will still be valid in the
            future. *THIS IS BAD!*
            #+begin_src rust
              fn main() {
                  let mut s = String::from("hello world");
                  let word = first_word(&s);
                  s.clear();

                  // operate `s` with `word` can lead to a crash.
              }
            #+end_src

            - If we want to write a ~second_word~, the /return value type/ is
              ~(usize, usize)~, which is tedious and even more brittle.

   - =NEXT= Rust has a solution to this problem: /string slices/.

        reference/ to a variable, we _CANNOT_ also take a /mutable reference/.

**** DONE String Literals Are Slices
     CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 15:46]
     Recall that we talked about /string literals/ being stored inside the binary.
     Now that we know about /slices/, we can properly understand /string literals/:
     ~let s = "Hello, world!";~, where the /type/ of ~s~ is ~&str~.
       It's a /slice/ pointing to that specific point of the binary. This is also
     why /string literals/ are *IMMUTABLE*; ~&str~ is an /immutable reference/.

**** DONE String Slices as Parameters
     CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 15:46]
     One move improvement on ~first_word~:
     change its /type signature/
     FROM ~fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {~
     TO ~fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {~

     - This change *makes our API more general and useful* WITHOUT losing any
       functionality:
       #+begin_src rust
         fn main() {
             let my_string = String::from("hello world");

             // first_word works on slices of `String`s
             let word_1 = first_word(&my_string[..]);

             let my_string_literal = "hello world";

             // first_word works on slices of string literals
             let word_2 = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);

             // since string literals *are* string slices already,
             // this works too, without the slice syntax!

     CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 15:46]
     /String slices/, as you might imagine, are specific to /strings/.
     BUT there's a _MORE GENERAL_ /slice type/, too.

     - For example (arrays),

         let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

         let slice = &a[1..3];

       * It works the same way as /string slices/ do, by storing a /reference/ to
         the first element and a length.

       * *You'll use this kind of /slice/ for all sorts of other collections.*

    - ~impl~ block.

    - /Methods/ can, just like any other parameter,
      * take ownership of ~self~,
      * borrow ~self~ immutably as we've done here,
      * borrow ~self~ mutably.

    - Having a /method/ that takes /ownership/ of the /instance/ by using just
      ~self~ as the first parameter is *RARE*:
      this technique is usually used when the /method/
      1. transforms ~self~ into something else
      2. we want to *PREVENT the caller FROM using the original instance AFTER
         the transformation.*

      =TODO= you can imagine -- it's rare to call a method and then the passed in
      object is no longer valid. Of course, this method can return a new object
      and disable the old one (=FROM Jian= a functional way, but I doubt if this
      is often used in Rust).

    - *Where's the -> Operator?* =TODO=
      * In C++,
        if ~object~ is a /pointer/,
        there are two equivalent ways to call a /method/:
        - ~object->something()~
        - ~(*object).something()~

      * Rust does NOT have an equivalent to the ~->~ operator;
        *Rust has a feature called /automatic referencing and dereferencing/.*
        Calling /methods/ is one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.

        + Here's how it works:
          when calling a /method/ with ~object.something()~,
          Rust AUTOMATICALLY adds in ~&~, ~&mut~, or ~*~ so ~object~ *matches* the
          /signatue/ of the /method/.
          - In other words, the following are the same: =FIXME= =broken textframe=
            * ~p1.distance(&p2);~
            * ~(&p1).distance(&p2);~

      * The first one, ~p1.distance(&p2);~, looks much cleaner.
        This *automatic referencing behavior* works because /methods/ have a CLEAR
        /receiver/ -- the type of ~self~.
        + Given the /receiver/ and name of a /method/, Rust can figure out
          definitively whether the /method/ is *reading* (~&self~), *mutating*
          (~&mut self~), or *consuming* (~self~).

        + The fact that Rust *makes /borrowing/ implicit* for /method receivers/
          is a big part of *making /ownership/ ergonomic* in practice.
          =from Jian= If not, use Rust in practice can be horrible.

  - This chapter will discuss:
    1. DEFINE and USE an /enum/ to show how an /enum/ can encode meaning along
       with data.

    2. EXPLORE a particularly useful /enum/, called ~Option~.

    3. LOOK AT how /pattern matching/ in the /match expression/ makes it easy to
       run different code for different values of an /enum/.

    4. COVER how the ~if let~ construct is another _convenient and concise_ idiom
       available to you to handle /enums/ in your code.

  - /Enums/ are a feature in many languages, but their capabilities _differ_ in
    each language.
      /Rust's enums/ are most similar to algebraic data types in functional
    languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.

** DONE Defining an Enum - 98

      Both values ~IpAddrKind::V4~ and ~IpAddrKind::V6~ are of the *SAME* /type/:
      ~IpAddrKind~.

        // The definition of `IpAddrKind` is in scope

      #+END_SRC

    - _Usually we *don't* use /enums/ in the way above._

            V6(String),

        let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
      #+END_SRC

      * This better than the way of composing ~enum~ and ~struct~ together:
        + more concise
        + No limitations about the address info
          - Since ipv4 always have four numeric components that will have values
            between 0 and 255, we want to store ~V4~ addresses as four ~u8~ values,
            and keep the ~V4~ addresses as one ~String~ value.
              This is not applicable if we use ~struct~:
            #+begin_src rust
              // Illegal syntax, just a illustration.
              struct IpAddr {
                  kind: IpAddrKind,
                  address: if kind is V6 then String else (u8, u8, u8, u8),
              }
            #+end_src

            /Enums/ can handle this case with ease:
            #+begin_src rust
              // We can do
              enum IpAddr {
                  V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
                  V6(String),

          }

          struct Ipv4Addr {
              // details elided
          }

          enum IpAddr {
              V4(Ipv4Addr),
              V6(Ipv6Addr),
          }
        #+END_SRC
        The standard library also define a specific ~struct~ for ~Ipv6Addr~ to
        make sure its content is legal for the ipv6 standard.

    - Another example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        // Use `enum`, all variants have the same type.
        // Write a function with this type of parameter(s) is simple.
        enum Message {
            Quit,  // no data
            Move { x: i32, y: i32 },  // include an anonymous struct
            Write(String),  // a single `String`
            ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),  // include three `i32` values
        }

        // If we use `struct`'s. There will be four types.
        //   It's hard to define a function to take any of these kinds of messages
        // as we could easily do with the `Message` enum.
        struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
        struct MoveMessage {
            x: i32,
            y: i32,
        }
        struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
        struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
      #+END_SRC

    - There is one _more similarity_ between /enums/ and /structs/:
      we're also able to define /methods/ on /enums/.
      * Here's a /method/ named ~call~ that we could define on our ~Message~ /enum/:
        #+begin_src rust
          impl Message {
              fn call(&self) {
                  // method body would be defined here
              }
          }

          let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
          m.call();
        #+end_src

*** DONE The ~Option~ Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values - 101
    CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 13:56]
    A case study:
    the ~Option~ enum in the standard library.

    As Tony Hoare, the inventor of null, mentioned, introduce /null/ to programming
    languages is a big mistake. However, the concept that /null/ is trying to
    express is still a useful one: a /null/ is a value that is currently invalid
    or absent for some reason. A new design is required! Here it is in Rust:
    #+BEGIN_SRC rust
      // Defined in the standard library (the prelude).
      // NO `Option::` prefix required.
      enum Option<T> {
          Some(T),
          None,
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - It is so useful that it's even included in the /prelude/.
      So do its variants -- no need to use ~Option::~ prefix to reference them.

    - The ~<T>~ part, /generics/, =TODO= Chapter 10

    - If we use ~None~ rahter than ~Some~, we need to tell Rust what type of
      ~Option<T>~ we have, because the compiler _CANNOT_ infer the type that the
      type that the ~Some~ variant will hold by looking only at a ~None~ value.

    - Discussion about WHY the ~Option<T>~ is better than ~null~.

** Summary - 110

* DONE 7. Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules - 111
  CLOSED: [2021-01-10 Sun 02:29]
  As you write large programs, organizing your code will be important because
  keeping track of your entire program in your head will become impossible.

  - By grouping related functionality and separating code with distinct features,
    you'll clarify where to find code that implements a particular feature and
    where to go to change how a feature works.

  - The programs we've written SO FAR have been _in *one* /module/ in *one* file._

    1. As a project grows, you can organize code by splitting it into *multiple*
       /modules/ and then *multiple* /files/.

    2. A /package/ can contain *multiple* /binary crates/ and _OPTIONALLY_ *one*
       /library crate/.
       * As a /package/ grows, you can extract parts into SEPARATE /crates/ that
         become /external dependencies/.

  - This chapter covers all these techniques.
    For very large projects of a set of INTERRELATED /packages/ that evolve
    together, Cargo provides /workspaces/, which we'll cover in the “Cargo
    Workspaces” section in Chapter 14. =TODO=

  - Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code's organization,
    including
    * which details are *exposed*,
    * which details are *private*, and
    * what _names_ are in each /scope/ in your programs.

  - These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the /module system/,
    include:
    * Packages :: A Cargo feature that lets you *build*, *test*, and *share* /crates/
    * Crates :: A tree of /modules/ that produces a /library/ or /executable/
    * Modules AND use :: Let you control the _organization_, /scope/, and _PRIVACY of paths_
    * Paths :: A way of naming an item, such as a /struct/, /function/, or /module/

  - In this chapter, we'll cover all these features,
    1. discuss how they interact, and

    2. explain how to use them to manage scope.

    3. By the end, you should have a solid understanding of the /module system/
       and be able to work with scopes like a pro!

** DONE Packages and Crates - 112
   CLOSED: [2021-01-07 Thu 15:21]
   The first parts of the /module system/ we'll cover are /packages/ and /crates/.

   - A /crate/ is a /binary/ OR /library/.
     The /crate root/ is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and
     makes up the /root module/ of your /crate/ (=TODO= we'll explain /modules/
     in depth in the “Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy” section). A
     /package/ is one or more /crates/ that provide a set of functionality. A
     /package/ contains a =Cargo.toml= file that _describes how to build_ those
     /crates/.

   - Several rules determine what a /package/ can contain.
     * A /package/ *must* contain zero or one /library crates/, and no more.

     * It can contain as many /binary crates/ as you'd like,
       but it *must* contain _at least one_ /crate/ (either /library/ or
       /binary/).

   - Let's walk through what happens when we create a /package/.
     1. =cargo new my-project=.
        Cargo created a =Cargo.toml= file, giving us a /package/.

        * Looking at the contents of =Cargo.toml=, there's no mention of
          =src/main.rs= because Cargo follows a convention that =src/main.rs= is
          the /crate root/ of a /binary crate/ with the *same name* as the
          /package/.
        
        * Likewise, Cargo knows that if the /package directory/ contains
          =src/lib.rs=, the /package/ contains a /library crate/ with the *same
          name* as the /package/, and =src/lib.rs= is its /crate root/. Cargo
          passes the /crate root/ files to =rustc= to *build* the /library/ or
          /binary/.

        * Here, we have a /package/ that only contains =src/main.rs=, meaning it
          ONLY contains a /binary crate/ named =my-project=.
            If a /package/ contains =src/main.rs= and =src/lib.rs=, it has *two*
          /crates/: a /library/ and a /binary/, both with the *same name* as the
          /package/.

        * A /package/ can have *multiple* /binary crates/ by placing files in
          the =src/bin= directory: _each file_ will be a separate /binary crate/.

   - A /crate/ will group related functionality together in a scope so the
     functionality is easy to share between *multiple* projects.

   - Keeping a /crate/'s functionality in its own scope clarifies whether particular
     functionality is defined in our /crate/ or the =rand= /crate/ and prevents
     potential conflicts.

   - =TODO= Let's move on and talk about the /module system/!
     
** DONE Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy - 113

   - In this section,
     * we'll talk about

       + other parts of the /module system/, namely
         - /paths/ that allow you to name items
         - the ~use~ /keyword/ that brings a /path/ into /scope/
         - the ~pub~ /keyword/ to make items public

     * We'll also discuss
       + the ~as~ /keyword/
       + /external packages/
       + the /glob operator/ =???= =TODO=

   - /Modules/ let us _organize code within a /crate/ into groups_ for readability
     and easy reuse.

   - /Modules/ also _control the PRIVACY of items_.

   - As an example,
     let's write a library crate that provides the functionality of a
     restaurant.

     * In the restaurant industry,
       some parts of a restaurant are referred to as _front of house_ and others
       as _back of house_.

       + Front of house ::
         where customers are; this is where hosts seat customers, servers take
         orders and payment, and bartenders make drinks.

       + Back of house ::
         where the chefs and cooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers clean up,
         and managers do administrative work.

     * To structure our /crate/ in the same way that a real restaurant works,
       we can organize the /functions/ into /nested modules/:
       Create a new library named restaurant by running
       =cargo new --lib restaurant=; then put the code in
       #+begin_src rust
         // Listing 7-1:
         // into src/lib.rs to define some modules and function signatures.
         mod front_of_house {
             mod hosting {
                 fn add_to_waitlist() {}

                 fn seat_at_table() {}
             }

             mod serving {
                 fn take_order() {}

                 fn serve_order() {}

                 fn take_payment() {}
             }
         }
       #+end_src

   - Earlier, we mentioned that =src/main.rs= and =src/lib.rs= are called /crate
     roots/.
       The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two
     files form a /module named crate/ at the root of the _crate's module
     structure_, known as the _module tree_.
     #+begin_src text
       Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.

         the *same* /module/ (~hosting~ and ~serving~ are defined within

         - Notice that the entire /module tree/ is rooted under the _implicit_

** DONE Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree - 115
   CLOSED: [2021-01-09 Sat 01:52]
   To show Rust where to find an item in a /module tree/, we use a /path/ in the
   same way we use a /path/ when navigating a filesystem.

   - If we want to call a /function/, we need to know its /path/.
   
   - A /path/ can take *TWO* forms:
     * An /absolute path/
       starts from a /crate root/ by using
       + a _crate name_
         OR
       + a literal ~crate~.

     * A /relative path/
       starts from the CURRENT /module/ and uses
       + ~self~
       + ~super~, or
       + an identifier in the CURRENT /module/.
   
   - BOTH /absolute and relative paths/ are followed by one or more identifiers
     _SEPARATED_ by double colons (~::~).

   - Let's return to the example in Listing 7-1.
     * Q :: How do we call the ~add_to_waitlist~ function?
            This is the same as asking, what's the path of the ~add_to_waitlist~
            function?

     * A :: We'll show _TWO_ ways to call the ~add_to_waitlist~ /function/ from a
            new function ~eat_at_restaurant~ defined in the /crate root/.
       *Note*: _this example *won't compile* just yet; =TODO= we'll explain why
               in a bit._
       #+begin_src rust
         // In Listing 7-3: we simplified our code a bit by removing some of the

             // Absolute path
             crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

             // Relative path
             front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
         }
       #+end_src
       + The ~eat_at_restaurant~ function is part of our /library crate's public
         API/, so we mark it with the ~pub~ keyword.

         into more detail about ~pub~.
         =FIXME= - =open quote use close quote character=.

   - The first time we call the ~add_to_waitlist~ function in ~eat_at_restaurant~,
     we use an absolute path. The ~add_to_waitlist~ function is defined in the same
     crate as ~eat_at_restaurant~, which means we can use the ~crate~ keyword to
     start an absolute path.

   - Choosing whether to use a /relative or absolute path/ is a decision you'll
     make based on your project. The decision should depend on
     * WHETHER you're more likely to move item /definition/ code *separately* from
     * OR *together* with
     the code that uses the item.

   - For example,
     * if we move the ~front_of_house~ /module/ and the ~eat_at_restaurant~
       /function/ into ~mod customer_experience~,
       we'd need to *update* the /absolute path/ to ~add_to_waitlist~,
       BUT the /relative path/ would *still be valid*.

     * However,
       if we moved the ~eat_at_restaurant~ /function/ *SEPARATELY* into
       ~mod dining~,
       the /absolute path/ to the ~add_to_waitlist~ call would *stay the same*,
       BUT the /relative path/ would need to be *updated*.

     Our preference is to specify /absolute paths/ because it's more likely to
     move code /definitions/ and item calls *independently* of each other.

   - /Modules/ aren't useful only for organizing your code.
     They also define Rust's /privacy boundary/.

   - The way /privacy/ works in Rust is that *ALL items (/functions/, /methods/,
     /structs/, /enums/, /modules/, and /constants/) are private by default*.
     * Same level object can use each other.
     * /parent module/ can't use the _private_ items inside /child modules/
     * items in /child modules/ can use the items in their /ancestor modules/

      Bringing the /function's parent module/ into /scope/ with ~use~ so we have
      to specify the /parent module/ when calling the /function/ makes it clear

    - /Re-exporting/ is useful when the internal structure of your code is
      _DIFFERENT from_ how programmers calling your code would think about the
      domain.
      * For example, in this _restaurant metaphor_,
        + the _people running the restaurant_ think about “front of house” and
          “back of house.”

        + BUT _customers_ visiting a restaurant probably won't think about the
          parts of the restaurant in those terms.
            With ~pub use~, we can *write our code with one structure but expose
          a different structure.* Doing so makes our library well organized for
          programmers working on the library and programmers calling the library.
      
*** DONE Using External Packages - 125
    CLOSED: [2021-01-10 Sun 00:53]
    - Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at
      crates.io, and pulling any of them into your package involves these same
      steps:
      listing them in your package's =Cargo.toml= file and using ~use~ to bring
      items _from their /crates/ into /scope/._ For example,
      #+begin_src toml
        [dependencies]
        rand = "0.5.5"
      #+end_src

    - Note that the /standard library (~std~)/ is also a /crate/ that's external
      to our /package/.
        Because the /standard library/ is shipped with the Rust language, _we don't
      need to change =Cargo.toml= to include ~std~._ BUT we do need to refer to it
      with use to bring items from there into our /package's scope/. For example,
      with ~HashMap~ we would use this line:

*** DONE Using Nested Paths to Clean Up Large ~use~ Lists - 126
    CLOSED: [2021-01-10 Sun 01:08]
    If we're using multiple items defined in the same /crate/ or same /module/,
    listing each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in
    our files. We can use /nested paths/ to simplify this:
      
    - Import items in the same level:
      #+begin_src rust
        // --snip--
        use std::cmp::Ordering;
        use std::io;
        // --snip--

        // Listing 7-18: Specifying a nested path to bring multiple items with the same
        //               prefix into scope
        // --snip--
        use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
        // --snip--
      #+end_src

    - Import items in different levels:
      #+begin_src rust
        // Listing 7-19: Two use statements where one is a subpath of the other
        use std::io;
        use std::io::Write;
      #+end_src
      
      can be simplified as

      #+begin_src rust

   So far, all the examples in this chapter _defined MULTIPLE /modules/ in ONE
   /file/._
     _When /modules/ get *large*,_ you might want to *MOVE their definitions TO a
   _separate file_ to make the code easier to navigate.*

   - For example,
     1. Let's start from the code in Listing 7-17
        #+begin_src rust
          // Listing 7-17

          // src/lib.rs
          mod front_of_house {
              pub mod hosting {
                  pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
              }
          }

          pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

          pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
              hosting::add_to_waitlist();
              hosting::add_to_waitlist();
              hosting::add_to_waitlist();
          }
        #+end_src
        
     2. Move the ~front_of_house~ /module/ to its own file =src/front_of_house.rs=
        by changing the /crate root/ file so it contains the code shown in
        Listing 7-21.
        *In this case, the /crate root file/ is =src/lib.rs=, but this procedure
        also works with /binary crates/ whose /crate root file/ is =src/main.rs=.*
        #+begin_src rust
          // Listing 7-21: Declaring the front_of_house module whose body will be in
          //               src/front_of_house.rs
          mod front_of_house;

          pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

          pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
              hosting::add_to_waitlist();
              hosting::add_to_waitlist();
              hosting::add_to_waitlist();
          }
        #+end_src
        =src/front_of_house.rs= gets the definitions FROM _the body of the
        ~front_of_house~ /module/._

          // Listing 7-22: Definitions inside the front_of_house module in
          //               src/front_of_house.rs
          pub mod hosting {
              pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
          }
        #+end_src
        Use ~mod front_of_house;~ RATHER THAN using a /block/ tells Rust to
        *load the contents of the /module/ from another file with the same
        name as the /module/.*
           
     3. To continue with our example and extract the ~hosting~ /module/ to its
        own file as well, we change =src/front_of_house.rs= to contain only the
        declaration of the ~hosting~ /module/:
        #+begin_src rust
          pub mod hosting;
        #+end_src
        Then we create a =src/front_of_house= directory and a file
        =src/front_of_house/hosting.rs= to contain the definitions made in
        the ~hosting~ /module/:
        #+begin_src rust
          pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        #+end_src

   - _The /module tree/ remains the SAME, and the /function/ calls in
     ~eat_at_restaurant~ will work *WITHOUT ANY MODIFICATION*,_ even though the
     definitions live in different files.
     * This technique lets you move modules to new files as they grow in size.

   - Note that the ~pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting~ statement in
     =src/lib.rs= also *HASN'T CHANGED*, nor does use have any impact on what
     files are compiled as part of the /crate/.

* DONE 8. Common Collections - 131 - =TODO= =PRACTICE=
  CLOSED: [2021-01-11 Mon 22:26]
  Rust's standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called
  /collections/.

  - *Unlike* the built-in /array/ and /tuple/ types,
    the data these collections point to is *stored on the /heap/,*
    which means the amount of data does _not need to be known at compile time_ and
    can *grow or shrink* as the program runs.

  - In this chapter, we'll discuss *THREE* /collections/ that are used very often
    in Rust programs:
    * A /vector/ allows you to store a _variable number of values_
      *next to each other*.

    * A /string/ is a _collection of characters_.
      We've mentioned the ~String~ type previously,
      BUT in this chapter we'll talk about it in depth.

    * A /hash map/ allows you to _associate a value with a particular key_.
      It's a particular implementation of the more general data structure called
      a map.

  - We'll discuss
    * how to *create* and *update*
      + /vectors/
      + /strings/
      + /hash maps/,
      as well as
    * what makes each special.

    complicated once we start to introduce /references/ to the elements of the
    /vector/. Let's tackle that next!

    - When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the
      /ownership/ and /borrowing rules/ (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure THIS
      /reference/ and ANY OTHER /references/ to the contents of the /vector/
      remain valid.
        Recall the rule that states you *can't* have /mutable and immutable
      references/ in the SAME /scope/. That rule applies in Listing 8-7, where we
      hold an /immutable reference/ to the first element in a /vector/ and try to
      add an element to the end, *which won't work if we also try to refer to
      that element later in the function*:

      The code in Listing 8-7 might look like it should work:
      * Q ::
        why should a /reference/ to the first element care about what changes at
        the end of the vector?

      * A ::
        This error is due to the way /vectors/ work:
        adding a new element onto the end of the /vector/ *might require allocating
        new memory and copying the old elements to the new space*, if there isn't
        enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the /vector/
        currently is.
          In that case, the /reference/ to the first element would be pointing to
        /deallocated memory/. The /borrowing rules/ *prevent* programs from
        ending up in that situation.

*** DONE Iterating over the Values in a Vector - 135
    CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 16:16]
    - We can iterate through all of the elements of a /vector/
      RATHER THAN use indices to access one at a time.

        // Listing 8-8:
        // Printing each element in a vector by iterating over the elements using a `for` loop

        let v = vec![100, 32, 57];

      To change the value that the /mutable reference/ refers to,
      we have to use the /dereference operator/ (~*~) to get to the value in ~i~
      before we can use the ~+=~ operator.
        =TODO= We'll talk more about the /dereference operator/ in the “Following
      the Pointer to the Value with the Dereference Operator” section of Chapter 15.
    
*** DONE Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types - 136
    CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 16:59]
    Combine /enum/ with /vectors/ to effectively save values of DIFFERENT /types/
    in to one /vector/, meanwhile keep the safety -- combine /enum/ with ~match~
    exhaustive checking feature can guarantee this.

    - For example,
      #+begin_src rust
        // Listing 8-10:
        // Defining an enum to store values of different types in one vector

        enum SpreadsheetCell {

    - Rust needs to know what /types/ will be in the /vector/ _at compile time_
      so it knows *exactly how much /memory/ on the /heap/ will be needed* to
      store each element.
      
    - =TODO= =???=
      When you're writing a program, if you don't know the exhaustive set of
      types the program will get _at runtime_ to store in a /vector/, the /enum/
      technique won't work.
      =TODO= =???=
      Instead, you can use a /trait object/, which we'll cover in Chapter 17.

    - Now that we've discussed some of the most common ways to use /vectors/,
      =TODO= be sure to review the API documentation for all the many useful methods
      defined on ~Vec<T>~ by the standard library.
        For example, in addition to push, a pop method removes and returns the
      last element. Let’s move on to the next collection type: ~String~!

** DONE Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings - 137
   CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 22:36]
   - Strings are an area that new Rustaceans commonly get stuck on.
     This is due to a combination of three things:  =???= =TODO=
     * Rust's propensity for making sure to expose possible errors,

     * strings being a more complicated data structure than many programmers give
       them credit for, and

     * UTF-8

   - It's useful to discuss /strings/ in the context of collections
     because
     /strings/ are implemented
     * as a /collection/ of /bytes/,
     * plus some /methods/ to provide useful functionality
       when those /bytes/ are interpreted as text.
     
   - In this section, we'll talk about the operations on ~String~ that every
     collection type has, such as *creating*, *updating*, and *reading*.

   - We'll also discuss the ways in which ~String~ is different from the other
     collections, namely how indexing into a ~String~ is complicated by the
     differences between how people and computers interpret String data.
     
*** DONE What Is a String? - 137 - =RE-READ=
    CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 19:46]
   Rust _actually_ *only has one* /string type/ in the _core language_ itself:
   ~str~, the /string slice/, which is usually seen in its /borrowed form/, ~&str~.

   - ~String~ is provided in the standard library of Rust, rather than coded into
     the *core language*, and is a _growable_, _mutable_, _owned_, _UTF-8 encoded_
     /string type/.

   - When Rustaceans talk about "strings", they usually mean both the ~String~
     and the /string slice/ ~&str~ types.

   - Alghough this section is largely about ~String~, both /types/ are used
     heavily in Rust's standard library.

   - Both ~String~ and /string slices/ are UTF-8 encoded.

   - =TODO=
     Read the API doc to get more details about the other /string types/,
     * standard library:
       + ~OsString~
       + ~OsStr~
       + ~CString~
       + ~CStr~

     * /library crates/ can provide even more options for storing string data.

     * See how those _names_ all end in ~String~ or ~Str~?
         They _refer to_ /owned and borrowed variants/, just like the ~String~ and
       ~str~ types you've seen previously.

     * These /string types/ can store text *in different encodings* OR *be
       represented in memory in a different way*, for example. We won't discuss
       these OTHER /string types/ in this chapter; =TODO= see their API
       documentation for more about how to use them and when each is
       appropriate.

*** DONE Creating a New String - 137
    CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 22:36]
    - Many of the same operations available with ~Vec<T>~ are available with
      ~String~ as well, starting with the ~new~ function to create a /string/:
      #+begin_src rust
        // Listing 8-11: Creating a new, empty `String`
        let mut s = String::new();
      #+end_src
      This line creates a NEW /empty string/ called ~s~, which we can then *load*
      data into.

    - Often, we'll have some initial data that we want to start the string with.
      For that, we use the ~to_string~ /method/, which is available on any type
      that implements the ~Display~ /trait/, as /string literals/ do. Listing
      8-12 shows two examples.
      #+begin_src rust
        // Listing 8-12:
        // Using the `to_string` method to create a `String` from a string literal

        let data = "initial contents";
        let s = data.to_string();

        // the method also works on a literal directly:
        let s = "initial contents".to_string();
      #+end_src

    - Two equivalent ways to get a ~String~ from a /string literal/.
      * ~let s = "initial contents".to_string();~
      * ~let s = String::from("initial contents");~
      Which you choose is a matter of style.

    - Remember that /strings/ are *UTF-8 encoded*, so we can include any properly
      encoded data in them, as shown in Listing 8-14.
      #+begin_src rust
        let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
        let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
        let hello = String::from("Hello");
        let hello = String::from("שָׁלוֹם");
        let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
        let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
        let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
        let hello = String::from("你好");
        let hello = String::from("Olá");

     CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 20:26]
     - ~+~
       #+BEGIN_SRC rust
         let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
         let s2 = String::from("world!");
         let s3 = s1 + &s2; // Note that s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used.
         // this is due to what does `+` do under the hood
         // `fn add(self, s: &str) -> String`.
       #+END_SRC
       ~fn add(self, s: &str) -> String~ is not the exact signature in the standard
       library. It is just a specific version that the /generics/ part is replaced
       with a concrete type ~String~.

       1. The ~&s2~ is ~&String~, and the ~add~ method requires ~&str~.
          * Q :: What happened makes this right?
          * A :: The compiler can /coerce/ the ~&String~ argument into a ~&str~.
              
          * When the ~add~ /method/ is called, Rust uses /deref coercion/, which
            here turns ~&s2~ into ~&s2[..]~.

          * =TODO= - =TODO= - =TODO=
            Discuss /deref coercion/ in more depth in Chapter 15.

          * Because ~add~ does NOT take /ownership/ of the ~s~ parameter, ~s2~ will still
            be a valid ~String~ after this operation.
          
       2. We can see the signature of ~add~ takes /ownership/ of ~self~, because
          ~self~ does NOT have an ~&~.
            This means s1 in Listing 8-18 will be moved into the add call and no
          longer be valid after that. So although let s3 = s1 + &s2; looks like it
          will copy both strings and create a new one, this statement actually
          takes ownership of s1, appends a copy of the contents of s2, and then
          returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks like it’s
          making a lot of copies but isn’t; the implementation is more efficient
          than copying.

     - Concatenate multiple strings:
       * The behavior of the ~+~ operator gets unwieldy (=from Jian= because of
         ~+~ is not symmetric to its LHS and RHS):
         #+begin_src rust
           let s1 = String::from("tic");
           let s2 = String::from("tac");
           let s3 = String::from("toe");

           let s = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;
         #+end_src
         
       * Use the ~format!~ macro:
         #+begin_src rust
           let s = format!("{}-{}-{}", s1, s2, s3);
         #+end_src
         This doesn't take /ownership/ of any of its parameters.
         The format string part of ~format!~ is the same as the ~println!~.

**** DONE Internal Representation - 141
     CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 22:22]
     A ~String~ is a wrapper over a ~Vec<u8>~.

     1. Let's look at some of our properly encoded UTF-8 example strings from
        Listing 8-14.
        #+begin_src rust
          let hello = String::from("Hola");  // 4 letters, 4 bytes long

          let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");  // 12 letters, 24 bytes long
        #+end_src
        From these two examples we know index into the string's bytes will *NOT
        ALWAYS* correlate to a valid /Unicode scalar value/.

     2. The above example can illustrate that
        index a UTF-8 string is completely different from indexing the bytes in
        a string.
          To avoid returning an unexpected value and causing bugs that might
        not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn't allow index a /string/.

**** DONE Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My! - 142
     CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 22:22]
     - Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually *THREE* relevant ways
       to look at /strings/ from Rust's perspective:
       * bytes,
       * scalar values,
       * /grapheme clusters/ (the closest thing to what we would call /letters/).

     - If we look at the Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script, it
       is stored as a /vector/ of ~u8~ values that looks like this:
       #+begin_src text
         [224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
         224, 165, 135]
       #+end_src
       * That's 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data.
         If we look at them as /Unicode scalar values/, which are what /Rust's
         ~char~ type/ is, those bytes look like this:
         #+begin_src text
           ['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']
         #+end_src
         + There are six char values here, but the fourth and sixth are *not*
           /letters/ -- they're /diacritics/ that don't make sense on their own.

       * Finally, if we look at them as /grapheme clusters/, we'd get what a
         person would call the *four* /letters/ that make up the Hindi word:
         #+begin_src text
           ["न", "म", "स्", "ते"]
         #+end_src

     - Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that
       computers store so that each program can choose the interpretation it
       needs, no matter what human language the data is in.

     - *A final reason Rust doesn't allow us to index into a ~String~ to get a
       character*:
       indexing operations are expected to always take constant time O(1).
       But *it isn't possible to guarantee that performance with a ~String~,*
       because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning
       to the index to determine how many valid characters there were.

*** DONE Slicing Strings - 142
    CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 22:34]
    - Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it's not clear what the
      return type of the string-indexing operation should be:
      * a byte value?
      * a character?
      * a grapheme cluster?
      * a string slice?
        
    - *THEREFORE*,
      Rust asks you to be more specific if you really need to use indices to
      create /string slices/.
        To be more specific in your indexing and indicate that you want a /string
      slice/,
      RATHER THAN indexing using ~[]~ with a single number,
      you can *use ~[]~ with a range* to create a /string slice/ containing
      particular bytes:
      #+begin_src rust
        let hello = "Здравствуйте";

        let s = &hello[0..4];
      #+end_src
      Here, ~s~ will be a ~&str~ that contains the _first 4 bytes_ of the /string/.
      Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was _2 bytes_, which
      means s will be ~Зд~.

    - Q :: What would happen if we used ~&hello[0..1]~?
    - A :: Rust would /panic/ _at runtime_
           in the same way as if an invalid index were accessed in a /vector/

    Fortunately, you can access elements in a /string/ in other ways.
    
    - Perform operations on individual /Unicode scalar/ values, the
      best way to do so is to use the ~chars~ /method/:

*** DONE Strings Are Not So Simple - 144
    CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 22:36]
    *To summarize, /strings/ are complicated.*

    Different programming languages make different choices about how to present
    this complexity to the programmer.
      Rust has chosen to make the correct handling of ~String~ data the default
    behavior for all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more
    thought into handling UTF-8 data upfront.
    - This trade-off
      * exposes more of the complexity of /strings/ than is apparent in other
        programming languages,
      * BUT it prevents you from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII
        characters later in your development life cycle.

        there's *no* built-in /macro/ to construct them, for example.
        =TODO= =TODO= =TODO=

    - Just like /vectors/, /hash maps/ store their data on the /heap/.

    - /Hash maps/ are *homogeneous*.

    - Another way of constructing a hash map is by using /iterators/ and the
      ~collect~ method on a /vector/ of /tuples/, where each /tuple/ consists of
      a key and its value.

    - =TODO=
      We'll be going into more detail about /iterators/ and their associated
      /methods/ in the ”Processing a Series of Items with Iterators” section of
      Chapter 13.

    - The ~collect~ /method/ gathers data into _a number of /collection types/,_
      including ~HashMap~. =from Jian= NOT only ~HashMap~.
      * For example, 
        #+begin_src rust
          // Listing 8-21:
          // Creating a hash map from a list of teams and a list of scores

              teams.into_iter().zip(initial_scores.into_iter()).collect();
        #+end_src
        Since ~collect~ can generate multiple types of collections, the /type
        annotation/ for ~scores~ must be given to tell what type of result it
        wants. However, the types of keys and values can be inferred, and this is
        why we can put two ~_~'s in the type parameters sites of ~HashMap~.

* DONE 9. Error Handling - 151
  CLOSED: [2021-01-13 Wed 03:09]
  - Rust groups errors into TWO major categories:
    * recoverable errors
    * unrecoverable errors - always symptoms of bugs

  - Most languages don't distinguish between these TWO kinds of errors and
    handle both in the same way, using mechanisms such as /exceptions/.

  - Rust doesn't have exceptions.
    Instead, it has
    * the type ~Result<T, E>~ for recoverable errors.
    * the ~panic!~ macro that stops execution when it encounters unrecoverable
      errors.

** DONE Unrecoverable Errors with ~panic!~ - 152
   CLOSED: [2021-01-07 Thu 01:25]
   - When this /macro/ executes, your program will:
     1. print a failure message
     2. unwind and clean up the stack
     3. quit

   - This most commonly occurs when a bug of some kind has been detected and
     it's _not clear_ to the programmer how to handle the error.

   - *Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic*
     * /unwinding/ :: walks back up the /stack/ and cleans up the data from each
                      function it encounters, but this walking and cleanup is a
                      lot of work.


     * the alternative is to _immediately abort_.
       1. No cleanup by the program.
       2. Memory need to be cleaned up by the OS.

     * If you want to make your _resulting binary as small as possible_,
       you can switch from /unwinding/ to /aborting/ on /panic/ by adding
       ~panic = 'abort'~ to the appropriate ~[profile]~ sections in the =Cargo.toml=.
       For example, if you want to abort on /panic/ in release mode, add this:
       #+BEGIN_SRC toml
         [profile.release]
         panic = 'abort'

*** DONE Shortcuts for Panic on Error: ~unwrap~ and ~expect~ - 159
    CLOSED: [2021-01-07 Thu 01:44]
    /Pattern matching/ is NOT always concise and communicate intent well.

    - ~unwrap~:
      ~let f = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();~
      If the value is the ~Ok~ /variant/, the inside value will be returned.
      If the value is the ~Err~ /variant/, a ~panic!~ /macro/ will be called.

    - ~expect~:
      Similar as ~unwrap~, but can take a message for the ~panic!~
      ~let f = File::open("hello.txt").expect("Failed to open hello.txt");~

    - If we call ~unwrap~ in multiple places, it will take time to find out
      which one is /panic/. For ~expect~, since different ones have different
      error messages, distinguish them is simple.

    Propagate errors, and give the control to the caller:

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        // Listing 9-6: A function that returns errors to the calling code using `match`
        use std::fs::File;
        use std::io;

        fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
            let f = File::open("hello.txt");

            let mut f = match f {
                Ok(file) => file,
                Err(e)   => return Err(e),
            };

            let mut s = String::new();

            match f.read_to_string(&mut s) {
                Ok(_)  => Ok(s),
                Err(e) => Err(e),
            }
        }
      #+END_SRC
      * The ~return~ above is imporatant!
        If NO ~return~, that ~Err(e)~ will be assigned to ~f~, rather than being
        returned. With this ~return~, we achieve "propagating errors".

    - This pattern of _propagating errors_ is so common in Rust that there is
      _dedicated syntax to make this easier_: ~?~.

             Ok(s)
         }
       #+end_src

     - /error values/ that have the ~?~ operator called on them go through /the
       ~from~ function/, defined in the ~From~ /trait/ in the standard library,
       which is used to _CONVERT errors FROM one type INTO another._

       * When the ~?~ operator calls the ~from~ function, the /error type/
         received is converted into the /error type/ defined in the /return
         type/ of _the CURRENT function_.

       * This is useful when a /function/ returns *one* /error type/ to represent
         all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many
         different reasons.
           As long as each error type implements the ~from~ function to define
         how to convert itself to the returned /error type/, then the ~?~ operator
         _takes care of the *conversion* AUTOMATICALLY._

     - The functions ~read_username_from_file~ of different versions in this
       ~Result<T, E>~ section are designed for illustrating error handling.
       If we don't care about this illustration, there is a standard library
       fucntion can do this with a single line:
       #+begin_src rust
         use std::fs;

** DONE To ~panic!~ or Not To ~panic!~ - 164
   CLOSED: [2021-01-13 Wed 03:09]
   - Q :: So how do you decide
     * when you should call ~panic!~ and
     * when you should return ~Result~?

   - A :: When code /panics/, there's no way to recover.

   - You could call ~panic!~ for any error situation, whether there's a possible
     way to recover or not,
     BUT then *you're making the decision on behalf of the code calling your
     code that a situation is unrecoverable.*
     * When you choose to return a ~Result~ value, you give the calling code
       options rather than making the decision for it.
         Therefore, *returning ~Result~ is a default choice* when you're defining
       a function that might fail.
       
   - In rare situations, it's more appropriate to write code that /panics/ instead
     of returning a ~Result~. =NEXT= Let's explore why it's appropriate to panic in
     * examples
     * prototype code
     * tests.

   - =NEXT=

     is impossible, but you as a human can.

   - =NEXT=
     The chapter will conclude with
     _some general guidelines on how to decide whether to *panic* in library
     code._
   
*** DONE Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests - 165
    CLOSED: [2021-01-13 Wed 01:00]
    - *EXAMPLES*:
      Have _robust error-handling code_ in the example
      as well can make the example _less clear_.

    - *PROTOTYPING*:
      the ~unwrap~ and ~expect~ /methods/ are very handy *when prototyping*,
      _BEFORE you're ready to decide how to handle errors._
        They leave clear markers in your code for when you're ready to make
      your program more robust.

    - *TESTS*
      You'd want the whole test to fail, even if that method isn't the
      functionality under test. Because ~panic!~ is how a test is marked as a
      failure, calling ~unwrap~ or ~expect~ is exactly what should happen.
        
*** DONE Cases in Which You Have More Information Than The Compiler -  165
    CLOSED: [2021-01-13 Wed 01:22]
    Sometimes, you may use a function that returns ~Result<T, E>~ values in such
    a specific context that you have more information than the compiler that you
    know the result is always a ~Ok<T>~ value. Then you can use ~unwrap~.
    
    - =from Jian=
      If the function you are using *ALWAYS* can do this, it means the design
      choice of your /function signature/ is wrong, and you should change your
      function return type from ~Result<T, E>~ to ~T~.

    - Example:
      #+begin_src rust
        use std::net::IpAddr;

        let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1".parse().unwrap();
      #+end_src
      * Here you provide a _string literal representation_ of a valid IP.
        You know the parse should and must be success.
    
      * However, when the data is _from the input_, there is _no promise to ~Ok~._

*** DONE Guidelines for Error Handling - 166 - =Re-READ=
    CLOSED: [2021-01-13 Wed 03:09]
    - It's advisable to have your code /panic/ =IMPORTANT= =RE-READ= =RE-READ= =RE-READ=
      when it's possible that your code could end up in a *bad state*.
      * bad state (in this context) :: when some _assumption_, _guarantee_,
        _contract_, or _invariant_ has been *broken*, such as
        + when /invalid values/, /contradictory values/, or /missing values/ are
          passed to your code -- plus one or more of the following:
          - The _bad state_ is
            *NOT* something that's EXPECTED to happen OCCASIONALLY.

          - Your code *after this point* needs
            to rely on *NOT* being in this _bad state_.

          - There's *NOT* a good way to
            encode this information in the /types/ you use.

    - _Your library,
      the others call functions defined inside your library:_
      1. Some well typed but invalid inputs are passed in;
      2. Use ~panic!~ to alert the person using your library to the bug in their code,
         so they can fix it during development.
         
    - Your are calling _external code_ that is _out of your control_ and
      it returns an _invalid state_ that you have no way of fixing.

    - However, _when failure is expected_, it's more appropriate to return a
      ~Result~ than to make a ~panic!~ call.
      * Examples:
        + a parser being given malformed data
        + an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate
          limit

      * In these cases, returning a ~Result~ indicates that _failure_ is an
        _EXPECTED POSSIBILITY_ that
        *the calling code must decide how to handle.*

    - When your code performs operations on values,
      your code should
      1. *verify* the values are _VALID_
      2. *panic* if the values are _NOT VALID_.

    - This is mostly for safety reasons:
      attempting to operate on _INVALID data_ can expose your code to
      *vulnerabilities*.

      * This is the main reason the _standard library_ will call ~panic!~ if you
        ATTEMPT an /out-of-bounds memory access/:
        trying to access memory that doesn't belong to the current data
        structure is a *common security problem*.
      
    - /Functions/ often have /contracts/:
      their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular
      requirements.

      * *Panicking* when the /contract/ is VIOLATED makes sense
        because
        *a _contract violation_ ALWAYS INDICATES a /caller-side bug/ and it's not
        a kind of error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle.*

        + In fact, there's no reasonable way for calling code to recover;
          the calling programmers need to fix the code.

        + /Contracts/ for a /function/, especially when a VIOLATION will cause a
          /panic/, should be explained in _the API documentation_ for the function.

    - However, having lots of /error checks/ in all of your /functions/ would be
      _VERBOSE and ANNOYING_.

      1. /Rust's type system/ (and thus the type checking the compiler does) to
         do many of the checks for you.

      2. /Function/ has a _particular type_ as a /parameter/, you can proceed
         with your code's logic knowing that the compiler has already ensured
         you have a valid value.

*** DONE Creating Custom Types for Validation - 167 - =RE-READ=
    CLOSED: [2021-01-13 Wed 03:03]
    In the "guessing game" in Chapter 2, we never validate the user's guess
    before before checking it against our secret number; we only validated
    that the guess was positive.

    - It would be a useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and
      have different behavior when a user guesses a number that's out of range
      versus when a user types, for example, letters instead.

    - One way to do this would be to parse the _guess_ as an ~i32~ instead of only
      a ~u32~ to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the
      number being in range, like so:
      #+begin_src rust
        loop {
            // --snip--

            let guess: i32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
                Ok(num) => num,
                Err(_) => continue,
            };

            if guess < 1 || guess > 100 {
                println!("The secret number will be between 1 and 100.");
                continue;
            }

            match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
                // --snip--
            }
        }
      #+end_src
      * However, _this is *not* an ideal solution_:
        if it was absolutely critical that the program only operated on values
        between 1 and 100, and it had many functions with this requirement,
        having a check like this in every function would be tedious (and might
        impact performance).

    - Instead, we can
      _make a new type_ and
      _put the validations in a function to create an instance of the type
      rather than repeating the validations everywhere._ Then
      1. it's safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures
      2. confidently use the values they receive.
      #+begin_src rust
        // Listing 9-10: A Guess type that will only continue with values between 1 and 100
        pub struct Guess {
            value: i32,
        }

        impl Guess {
            pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
                if value < 1 || value > 100 {
                    panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.", value);
                }

                Guess { value }
            }

            pub fn value(&self) -> i32 {
                self.value
            }
        }
      #+end_src
      * Remember, the non-~pub~ /field/ of a /struct/ is *private*.

      * Implement an /associated function/ named ~new~ on ~Guess~ that
        _creates instances of ~Guess~ values._
        + If value doesn't pass the range check, we make a ~panic!~ call, which
          will alert the programmer who is author of the calling code that they
          have a bug they need to fix,
          because _creating a ~Guess~ with a value outside this range would
          violate the contract that ~Guess::new~ is relying on._

        + The conditions in which ~Guess::new~ might *panic* should be discussed
          in its public-facing API documentation;
          =TODO= we'll cover documentation conventions indicating the possibility
          of a ~panic!~ in the API documentation that you create in Chapter 14.

      * The /public method/ ~value~ is a getter, which is used to get the value
        of the /private field/ ~value~ of ~Guess~ /struct/.
        + code _outside the module_ *must* use the ~Guess::new~ /function/ to
          create an /instance/ of ~Guess~,
          thereby ENSURING _there's *no way* for a ~Guess~ to have a value that
          hasn't been checked by the conditions in the ~Guess::new~ function._

      * Use ~Guess~ as a /parameter/ or /returns/ of a /function/
        CAN GUARANTEE
        the ~value~ in it is in the range from 1 to 100 exclusive.
        Then there is not need to do any additional checks in its body.

    CLOSED: [2021-01-10 Sun 15:42]
    Sometimes it's useful to have /default behavior/ for some or all of the
    /methods/ in a /trait/ instead of requiring implementations for ALL
    /methods/ on EVERY /type/.
      Then, as we implement the /trait/ _on a PARTICULAR /type/,_ we can keep or
    *override* each /method's default behavior/.
    
    - A /trait definition/ that includes a /default implemention/,
      #+begin_src rust
        // Listing 10-14: Definition of a Summary trait with a default implementation of
        //                the summarize method

    - The syntax for overriding a default implementation is exactly _the same as_
      the syntax for implementing a trait method that doesn't have a /default
      implementation/.
      * This is why even if we include a /default implemention/ in ~Summary~,
        this won't affect the code in 10-13 about ~Tweet~.
      
    - /Default implementations/ are allowed to call the other methods in the same
      trait, even if those other methods don't have a /default implementation/.

     The ~impl Trait~ syntax works for straightforward cases but is _actually
     syntax sugar for a longer form, which is called a /trait bound/;_ it looks
     like this:
     #+begin_src rust
       pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
           println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
       }
     #+end_src
     
     - The ~impl Trait~ syntax is _convenient_ and makes for _more concise_ code
       _in simple cases._
       The /trait bound/ syntax _can express more complexity_ in other cases.

       Here is a example:
       #+begin_src rust
         pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {}
       #+end_src
       * If ~item1~ and ~item2~ have *different types*, using ~impl Trait~ would
         be appropriate.

       * If we wanted to _FORCE BOTH parameters to have the *same type*,_
         that's only possible to express using a /trait bound/, and we _MUST_
         re-write the above example as:
         #+begin_src rust
           pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {}

**** DONE Clearer Trait Bounds with ~where~ Clauses - 188
     CLOSED: [2021-01-10 Sun 16:04]
     Rust has _ALTERNATE syntax_ for specifying /trait bounds/ inside a ~where~
     clause after the /function signature/.
       This syntax is less cluttered than the syntax we see before this section
     when using *many* /trait bounds/:
     #+begin_src rust
       fn some_function<T: Clone + Display , U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {}
     #+end_src
     
     can be written with ~where~ as:
     
     #+begin_src rust
       fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
           where T: Clone + Display,

**** DONE Returning Types that Implement Traits - 188
     CLOSED: [2021-01-10 Sun 16:14]
     We can also use the ~impl Trait~ syntax in the _return position_ to return a
     value of some /type/ that implements a /trait/.

     - Example:
       #+BEGIN_SRC rust
         pub fn return_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
             Tweet {
                 username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
                 content: String::from("of course, as you probably already know, people"),
                 reply: false,
                 retweet: false
             }
         }
       #+END_SRC

     - =TODO=
       The ability to _return a /type/ that is only specified by the /trait/ it
       implements_ is especially useful in the context of /closures/ and /iterators/,
       =TODO= which we cover in Chapter 13.

       * /Closures/ and /iterators/ create /types/ that _only the compiler knows_
         or _types that are very long to specify_.
           The ~impl Trait~ syntax lets you concisely specify that a function
         returns some type that implements the ~Iterator~ /trait/ *WITHOUT
         needing to write out a very LONG /type/.*

     - However, you can only use ~impl Trait~ if you're returning a single type.
       For example, this code that returns either a ~NewsArticle~ or a ~Tweet~
       with _the /return type/ specified as ~impl Summary~ *wouldn't work*:_
       #+begin_src rust
         // DOESN'T COMPILE!!!

** DONE 10.3 Validating References with Lifetimes - 192
   CLOSED: [2021-01-11 Mon 03:55]
   - One detail we didn't discuss in
     _the “References and Borrowing” section in Chapter 4_
     is that EVERY /reference/ in Rust has a /lifetime/, which is the /scope/ for
     which that /reference/ is VALID.
     * =from Jian=
       This is a completion of the “References and Borrowing” section.
       Go back to read this seciton again.

   - MOST of the time /lifetimes/ are _implict_ and _inferred_, just like most of
     the time /types/ are inferred.

   - Since there are cases that the /lifetimes/ of /references/ could be related
     in a few DIFFERENT WAYS, Rust needs us to annotate the relationships using
     /generic lifetime parameters/ so that it can make sure the actual references
     used at runtime will definitely be valid.

   - Although we won't cover /lifetimes/ in their entirety in this chapter, we'll
     discuss common ways you might encounter /lifetime/ syntax so you can become
     familiar with the concepts.

*** DONE Lifetime Annotation Syntax - 196
    CLOSED: [2021-01-11 Mon 00:46]
    - /Lifetime/ annotations DO NOT change how long any of the /references/
      involved live.

    - Just as /functions/ can accept _ANY /type/_ when the /signature/ specifies
      a /generic TYPE parameter/, functions can accept /references/ with _ANY
      /lifetime/_ by specifying a /generic LIFETIME parameter/.
      * This means *isolated single* /lifetime annotation/ deesn't have much
        meaning.

    - /lifetime annotations/ *relate* the /lifetimes/ of multiple /references/ to
      each other.

    - /Lifetime annotation/ syntax:
      * start with ~'~
      * usually all lowercase
      * usually very short
      * after the ~&~ of a reference, and
      * a space *separates* the /lifetime annotation/ from the /reference's type/.

    - Examples:
      * a reference: ~&i32~
      * a reference with an explicit lifetime: ~&'a i32~
      * a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime: ~&'a mut i32~

*** DONE Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures - 197
    CLOSED: [2021-01-11 Mon 03:55]
    Now let's examine /lifetime annotations/ in the context of the ~longest~
    /function/. 
    #+BEGIN_SRC rust
      fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
          if x.len() > y.len() {
              x
          } else {
              y
          }
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - The /function signature/ now tells Rust that
      for some /lifetime/ ~'a~,
      * the function takes two /parameters/, both of which are /string slices/
        that *live at least as long as /lifetime/ ~'a~.*

      * the /string slice/ returned from the /function/ will
        *live at least as long as /lifetime/ ~'a~.*

    - In practice, the /function signature/ means that
      the /lifetime/ of the _returned /reference/_ is *the same as the smaller*
      of the /lifetimes/ of the _passed-in /references/._ -- these constraints
      are what we want Rust to enforce.

    - Remember,
      when we specify the /lifetime parameters/ in a /function signature/,
      we're *NOT* changing the /lifetimes/ of any values passed in or returned.
        Rather, we're specifying that the _borrow checker_ should *reject* _any
      values that don't adhere to these /constraints/._

    - Note:
      the ~longest~ /function/
      * *doesn't need to know* EXACTLY how long ~x~ and ~y~ will live,
      * ONLY that some /scope/ can be substituted for ~'a~ that will satisfy this
        /signature/.

    - When annotating /lifetimes/ in /functions/,
      * the annotations go in the /function signature/,
      * *not* in the /function body/.

    - Rust can analyze the code *within* the function without any help.
    - However, when a /function/ has /references/ *to or from code outside* that
      /function/, it becomes *ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE* for Rust to figure out _the
      /lifetimes/ of the parameters_ or _return values_ on its own.
      The /lifetimes/ might be different each time the /function/ is called.
      * =from Jian=
        This is why we need manually annotated /lifetime/ relationship, which can
        help providing extra info to eliminate ambiguity.

    - When we pass /concrete references/ to ~longest~, the /concrete lifetime/
      that is substituted for ~'a~ is the part of the /scope/ of ~x~ that overlaps
      with the /scope/ of ~y~.
        In other words, the /generic lifetime/ ~'a~ will get the /concrete
      lifetime/ that _is EQUAL to_ *the _SMALLER_ of the /lifetimes/ of ~x~ and
      ~y~.*

        Because we've annotated the /returned reference/ with the SAME /lifetime
      parameter/ ~'a~, *the /returned reference/ will also be valid for the
      length of the _SMALLER_ of the /lifetimes/ of ~x~ and ~y~.*

    - Let's look at how the lifetime annotations restrict the longest function by
      passing in references that have different concrete lifetimes. Listing
      10-23 is a straightforward example.
      #+begin_src rust
        // Listing 10-23: Using the longest function with references to String values
        //                that have different concrete lifetimes

                println!("The longest string is {}", result);

      The problem is that ~result~ _goes out of scope_ and _gets cleaned up at the
      end of the ~longest~ function._ There is no way we can specify /lifetime
      parameters/ that would change the /dangling reference/, and Rust won't let
      us create a /dangling reference/.
      * In this case, the best fix would be return an /owned data type/:
        ~String~.

    - Ultimately, _lifetime syntax_ is about *connecting* the /lifetimes/ of _various
      arguments_ *and* _return values_ of functions.
        Once they're connected, Rust has enough information to allow memory-safe
      operations and disallow operations that would create /dangling pointers/ or
      _otherwise violate memory safety_.

      * Pre-1.0 Rust wouldn't have this program compiled.
        EVERY /reference/ needed an EXPLICIT /lifetime/.

      * After coding a lot, the Rust team found there are some situations that
        were predictable and followed a few deterministic patterns.
          Then the Rust team code programmed these patterns into the compiler's
        code so the _borrow checker_ could infer the /lifetimes/ in these
        situations and wouldn't need EXPLICIT annotations.

      * This piece of Rust history is relevant
        BECAUSE it's possible that more deterministic patterns will emerge and
        be added to the compiler. In the future, even fewer lifetime annotations
        might be required.

    - /lifetime elision rules/ ::
      a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your
      code fits these cases, you don't need to write the /lifetimes/ EXPLICITLY.

    - The /elision rules/ do *NOT* provide _FULL_ inference:
      if there is still ambiguity after applying these rules, Rust will issue an
      error.

    - /input lifetimes/: lifetimes on function parameters or method parameters.

    - /output lifetimes/: lifetimes on return values.

    - The compiler uses _THREE_ rules to figure out what /lifetimes/ /references/
      have when there aren't EXPLICIT annotations.
      * The _first_ rule applies to /input lifetimes/
      * the _second and third_ rules apply to /output lifetimes/.

      If the compiler gets to the end of the _THREE_ rules and there are still
      /references/ for which it can't figure out /lifetimes/, the compiler will
      stop with an error. These rules apply to ~fn~ definitions as well as ~impl~
      blocks.

    - /Elision Rules/:
      1. Each parameter that is a /reference/ gets its _OWN_ /lifetime parameter/.
         In other words,
         * a function with one parameter gets one /lifetime parameter/:
           #+begin_src rust
             fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)
           #+end_src
         * a function with two arguments gets two separate lifetime parameters:
           #+begin_src rust
             fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32)
           #+end_src
         * and so on.

      2. If there is *exactly one* /input lifetime parameter/, that /lifetime/ is
         assigned to *ALL* /output lifetime parameters/:
         #+begin_src rust
           fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32
         #+end_src

      3. If there are MULTIPLE /input lifetime parameters/, but one of them is
         ~&self~ or ~&mut self~ because this is a /method/, then the /lifetime/
         of ~self~ is assigned to *all* /output lifetime parameters/.
         _This makes /methods/ much nicer to read and write because it gets rid of
         cluter symbols._

    - Let's practice to apply these rules:
      * ~fn first_word(s: str) -> &str {~
        + rule 1 - ~fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str {~
        + rule 2 - ~fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {~

      * ~fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {~
        + rule 1 - ~fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str {~
        + rule 2 - NOT *exactly one* /input parameter/, can't apply this rule
        + rule 2 - NOT a /method/, can't apply this rule

    - =NEXT=
      Because the _third rule_ only really applied in /method signatures/,
      let's look at /lifetimes/ in that context now, and see why the _third rule_
      means we don't have to annotate /lifetimes/ in /method signatures/ very often.

    CLOSED: [2021-01-11 Mon 01:08]
    - ~'stack~ :: the entire duration of the program.

    - Example:
      #+begin_src rust
        let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
      #+end_src
      The text of this /string/ is _stored directly in the binary of your program_
      and the binary of your program is always available.
      Therefore, *the lifetime of all /string literals/ is ~'static~.*

    - Sometimes compiler suggests you to use ~'static~ somewhere. =IMPORTANT=
      * But before specifying ~'static~ as the /lifetime/ for a /reference/,
        Ask yourself
        + Q :: WHETHER the /reference/ you have actually lives the ENTIRE /lifetime/
                of your program or not.

        + You might consider whether you want it to live that long, even if it
          could.

        + _MOST of the time,_
          the problem results from attempting to /create a dangling reference/
          or _a mismatch of the available /lifetimes/._
            In such cases, the solution is fixing those problems, not specifying
          the ~'static~ /lifetime/ to walkaround.

   - the ~should_panic~ /attribute/.

*** DONE The Anatomy of a Test Function - 208
    CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 01:46]
    - At its simplest,
      a /test/ in Rust is a /function/ that's annotated with the ~test~
      /attribute/.

    - attributes :: metadata about pieces of Rust code.
      * Examples:
        + The ~derive~ we see in Chapter 5
        + The ~test~ we will see in this Chapter

    - When you run your _tests_ with the =cargo test= command,
      Rust builds a /test runner binary/ that
      1. *runs* the functions annotated with the ~test~ /attribute/
        and
      2. *reports* on whether each _test function_ passes or fails.

    - TEST

           + There are _non-test helper functions_ in the ~tests~ /module/,
             so we need to *indicate* which /functions/ are _tests_ with the

*** DONE Checking Results with the ~assert!~ Macro - 211
    CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 01:52]
    - ~assert!~ is useful when you want to ensure that some condition in a test
      evaluates to ~true~.
      * If is ~true~, do nothing
      * If is ~false~, it calls the ~panic!~

    - In Chapter 4, Listing 5-15, we have =src/lib.rs=:

        #[derive(Debug)]

        + ~assert_eq!~ and ~assert_ne!~ take arguments with no order constraints:
          In some languages test framework, there is =expected= and =actual=,
          while Rust doesn't -- it uses the terms =left= and =right=.

    - ~assert_ne!~ is most useful for cases
      when we're not sure what a value will be,
      but we know what the value definitely won't be if our code is functioning
      as we intend.

    - ~assert_eq!~ and ~assert_ne!~ /macros/ can only compare values whoes types
      implement
      * ~PartialEq~, because under the surface these /macros/ uses ~==~ and ~!=~.
      * ~Debug~, because when the _assertions fail_, these /macros/ *print* their
        arguments using /debug formatting/.

    - We can create a bug by removing the ~|| value > 100~ part,
      and the test will fail. We will see the message is _NOT very useful_.
      * The above ~should_panic~ can be imprecise:
        ANY /panic/ can satisfy it, even though it's not what we expect.
        We can add an _optional ~expected~ parameter_ to the ~should_panic~
        /attribute/. A _substring_ of the /panic message/ is enough.

    - You *can't* use the ~#[should_panic]~ /annotation/ on tests that use

   - Can specify command line options to change the _defaut behavior_ of =cargo test=.
     * The _default behavior_ of the binary produced by =cargo test= is to

       2. capture output generated during test runs,
          preventing the output from being displayed and
       3. making it easier to read the output related to the test results.

** DONE Test Organization - 227
   CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:45]
   - The Rust community thinks about tests in terms of _TWO main categories_:
     * unit tests ::
       _small_ and _more focused_, testing _one module in isolation_ at a time,
       and *can test /private interfaces/.*

     * integration tests ::
       *entirely external* to your library and use your code _in the same way
       any other external code would_, using
       + *ONLY* the /public interface/
       + potentially exercising *MULTIPLE* /modules/ per test.

   - Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your
     library are doing what you expect them to, _separately and together._

*** DONE Unit Tests - 227
    CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:15]
    - Put /unit tests/ in the =src= directory, in each file with the code that
      they're testing.

    - _CONVENTION_:
      create a /module/ named ~tests~ *in each file* to contain the _test
      functions_, and we annotate the /module/ with ~cfg(test)~.

**** DONE The Tests Module and ~#[cfg(test)]~ - 227
     CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:08]
     - The ~#[cfg(test)]~ annotation on the /tests module/ tells Rust to compile
       and run the test code _ONLY_ when we run ~cargo test~, and not when we run
       ~cargo build~. This
       * *saves* /compile time/
         when you only want to BUILD the library

       * *saves* _space_ in the _resulting compiled artifact_
         because the tests are not included. 

     - /integration tests/ go in a different directory, they don't need the
       ~[cfg(test)]~ annotation.

**** DONE Testing Private Functions - 227
     CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:15]
     There's debate within the testing community about
     *whether or not private functions should be tested directly,*
     and other languages make it difficult or impossible to test private functions.

     Regardless of which testing ideology you adhere to,
     =IMPORTANT= _Rust's privacy rules do *allow* you to TEST /private functions/._
     
     - Example:
       #+begin_src rust
         pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
             internal_adder(a, 2)
         }

         // a function is *private* by default
         fn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
             a + b
         }

         #[cfg(test)]

*** DONE Integration Tests - 228
    CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:45]
    In Rust, integration tests are _entirely external_ to your library -- they
    use your library in the same way any other code would, which means they can
    only call functions that are part of your library's public API (/private
    functions/ tests are already done in the /unit tests/ part).
    
    - Units of code that work correctly on their own could have problems when
      integrated, so *test /coverage/ of the /integrated code/ is important as
      well.*

    - To create /integration tests/, you first need a =tests= directory.

**** DONE The =tests= Directory - 229
     CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:45]
     - Make a =tests= directory in the top level of your project, next to =src=.
       * Cargo knows to look for /integration test/ files in this directory.

       * We can make as many test files as we want =FIXME= (remove "to") in this
         directory, and Cargo will compile *each* of the files as an *individual*
         /crate/.
         
     - Example:
       #+begin_src rust
         // Listing 11-13: An integration test of a function in the adder crate

         // tests/integration_test.rs
         use adder;

         #[test]
         fn it_adds_two() {
             assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
         }
       #+end_src
       * ~use adder~:
         _each file_ in the tests directory is a *separate* /crate/,
         so we need to bring our library into each test /crate's scope/.

       * ~$ cargo test~ output:

         The /integration tests/ section starts with the line
         =Running target/debug/deps/integration_test-ce99bcc2479f4607=
         =FIXME= this hash is different from the one above.

     - We can still run a *particular* _integration test function_
       by specifying the _test function's name_ as an argument to ~cargo test~.

     - To run _ALL the tests_ in a PARTICULAR _integration test file,_
       use the ~--test~ argument of ~cargo test~ followed by the name of the
       file: ~cargo test --test integration_test~

**** DONE Submodules in integration Tests - 230
     CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:45]
     As mentioned earlier, _each file_ in the =tests= directory is compiled as
     its own *separate* /crate/.

     - Treating _each /integration test/ file_ as _its own crate_ is useful to
       create *separate* /scopes/ that are more like the way end users will be
       using your /crate/ (=from Jian= Every /integration test/ file simulate
       one end user use case. Of course differnt users use cases should be in
       DIFFERENT /scope/).
       =TODO= =RECALL=
         However, this means files in the =tests= directory don't share the
       same behavior as files in =src= do, as you learned in Chapter 7 regarding
       how to separate code into /modules/ and /files/.
     
     - Sometimes you want to _extract some common functions into a file_, and
       the other /integration tests/ (in multiple files) use it.
       * If you put it in a file (assume its name is =common.rs=) directly in
         =tests=, Cargo will consider it as a /integration tests/, even if it may
         not contain any ~#[test]~, and add a section for it in th output of
         ~cargo test~ -- _this is usually *NOT* what we want._

       * Rather than =common.rs=, we should put the common code into
         =tests/common/mod.rs=. This is an _alternate naming convention_ that
         Rust also understands.
           Naming the file this way _tells Rust *not* to treat the ~common~
         /module/ as an /integration test file/._ Then we have a expected output
         in ~cargo test~.

     - Example:
       #+begin_src rust
         use adder;

         mod common;

         #[test]
         fn it_adds_two() {
             common::setup();
             assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
         }
       #+end_src
       * Note:
         the ~mod common;~ /declaration/ is the same as the /module declaration/
         we demonstrated in Listing 7-21.

**** DONE Integration Tests for Binary Crates - 232
     CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:45]
     - If our project is a binary crate that _ONLY_ contains a =src/main.rs= and
       does not have a =src/lib.rs=, we are *NOT able* to create /integration tests/
       in the =tests= directory and bring functions defined in the =src/main.rs=
       file into scope with a ~use~ statement.

     - Only /library crates/ expose functions that OTHER /crates/ are able to call
       and use; /binary crates/ are meant to be run on their own.

       * This is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a
         STRAIGHTFORWARD =src/main.rs= that calls logic that lives in
         =src/lib.rs=.
           With that structure, /integration tests/ *can test* the /library
         crate/ with ~use~ to make the important functionality available.
         + If the important functionality works, the small amount of code in
           =src/main.rs= will work as well, and that small amount of code does
           not need to be tested.

** DONE Summary - 232
   CLOSED: [2021-01-15 Fri 03:46]

* TODO 12. An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program - 233 - =start=
  - This chapter is both
    * a recap of many skills
    * an exploration of a few more standard library features

  - Make our own version of the classic command line tool ~grep~ (Globally search
    a Regular Expression and Print).

  - In the simplest use case, ~grep~ searches a specified file for a specified
    string using the following steps:
    * Take as arguments a filename and a string.
    * Read the file.
    * Find lines in the file that contain the string argument.
    * Print out those lines.

  - We'll also show how to use environment variables and print to standard error
    instead of standard out; these tech are commonly used in command line tools.

  - ~ripgrep~ is a fully-featured and faster version of ~grep~ implemented by
    Andrew Gallant by using Rust.

  - This project will bring together a number of concepts you've learned so far:
    * Organizing code (using what we learned in modules, _Chapter 7_)
    * Using vectors and strings (collections, _Chapter 8_)
    * Handling errors (_Chapter 9_)
    * Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (_Chapter 10_)
    * Writing tests (_Chapter 11_)

  - We'll also briefly introduce /closures/, /iterators/, and /trait objects/,
    which Chapter 13 and 17 will cover in detail =TODO=.

  - ~cargo new --bin greprs~

** DONE Accepting Command Line Arguments - 234
   CLOSED: [2017-08-27 Sun 18:48]
   Our first task is to make ~greprs~ able to accept its two command line
   arguments:
   - the file name
   - a string to search for.

   The result is we can use a command of the pattern
   ~cargo run searchstring example-filename.txt~

*** DONE Reading the Argument Values - 234
    CLOSED: [2017-08-27 Sun 18:44]
    Use Rust standard library ~std::env::args~, which returns an /iterator/ of
    the command line arguments that were given to our program.

    - =TODO= /iterator/ will be fully covered in Chapter 13.

    - For now, two things we need to know about the /iterator/:
      1. Iterator produce a series of values
      2. We can call the ~collect~ function on iterator to turn it into a vector
         containing all of the elements the iterator produces.

    - Example (use /iterator/):
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        use std::env;

        fn main() {
            let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
            println!("{:?}", args);
        }
      #+END_SRC
      * As we talked about in Chapter 7,
        in cases where the desired function is nested in more than one module,
        it's CONVENTIONAL to _bring the parent module into scope_, rather than
        the function itself.

      * ~std::env::args~ will panic if any argument containts invalid Unicode.

      * To take arguments with invalid Unicode, use ~std::env::args_os~, which
        returns ~OsString~.

          ~OsString~ values differ per-platform and are more complex to work
        with than ~String~ values.

      * Run:

   - ~std::io::prelude::*~ contains various traits taht are useful when doing
     I/O, including file I/O.

   - Don't be confused with /prelude/
     * Here we use ~std::io::prelude::*~
     * There is also a general ~prelude~ which is always brought in
       automatically, unless you disable it (=From Jian= HOW TO???).

   - We've got a few flaws though:
     * the ~main~ function has multiple responsibilities
     * we're not handling errors as well as we could be.

   - While our program is still small, these flaws aren't a big problem, but as
     our program grows, it will be harder to fix them cleanly.

     _Refactor earlier is good, while optimize earlier is bad_
     It's good practice to begin _refactoring early_ on when developing a
     program, as it's much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code, so we'll
     do that now.

** DONE Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling - 238
   CLOSED: [2017-08-28 Mon 02:19]
   - _OLD TITLE_: Improving Error Handling and Modularity

   - There are _FOUR_ problems that we'd like to fix to improve our program, they
     have to do with:
     * the way the program is structured
     * how it's handling potential errors

   - Problem 1 :: ~main~ contains more than one tasks:
     1. parse arguments
     2. open up files.

   - Solution to P1 :: It's better to separate out functionality so that each
                      function is responsible for one task.

   - Problem 2 :: If later we have more configuration variables (like ~filename~,
                  ~contents~), it will become hard to track them.

   - Solution to P2 :: It's better to group the configuration variables into one
                       structure to make their purpose clear.

   - Problem 3 :: If there is an error when opening up the given file, the
                       error message is always =file not found=, which should NOT
                       always the case.

   - Solution to P3 :: Find a way to give right advices through the error
                       message.

   - Problem 4 :: It would be better if all our error handling code was in
                  one place so that future maintainers only have on place
                  to consult in the code if the error handling logic needs to
                  change.

   - Solution to P4 :: Put them together.

*** DONE Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects - 239
    CLOSED: [2017-08-27 Sun 21:43]
    - The organizational guidelines has the following steps:
      1. Split your program into both a ~main.rs~ and a ~lib.rs~ and move your
         program's logic into ~lib.rs~.

      2. While your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in
         ~main.rs~.

      3. When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract
         it from ~main.rs~ into ~lib.rs~ as well.

      4. The responsibilities that remain in the ~main~ function after this
         process should be:
         * Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
         * Setting up any other configuration
         * Calling a ~run~ function in ~lib.rs~
         * If ~run~ returns an error, handling that error

    - This pattern is all about separating concerns:
      * ~main.rs~ handles running the program
      * ~lib.rs~ handles all of the logic of the task at hand.

      Because we can't test the ~main~ function directly, this structure lets us
      test all of our program's logic by moving it into functions in ~lib.rs~.
      The only code that remains in ~main.rs~ will be small enough to verify its
      correctness by reading it. Let's re-work our program by following this
      process.

     CLOSED: [2017-08-27 Sun 23:29]
     - A sign that we don't have the right abstraction yet:
         We're returning a tuple, but when we immediately break that tuple up into
       individual parts again.

     - Another indicator:
       The two values we return are related and are both part of one configuration
       value. We're not currently conveying this meaning in the structure of the
       data other than grouping the two values into a tuple -- the can be a
       stronger structure -- ~struct~.

       This will make it easier for future maintainers of this code to understand
       how the different values relate to each other and what their purpose is.

** DONE Closures: Anonymous Functions That Can Capture Their Environment - 264
   CLOSED: [2021-01-16 Sat 03:34]
   - /Rust's closures/ are _allowed to *capture* values_ from the /scope/ in which
     they are defined.

   - Rust /functions/ are _NOT allowed to capture values_ from the /scope/ in which
     they are defined,
     =from Jian= which is _different_ from most of they other languages.

*** DONE Creating an Abstraction of Behavior with Closure - 264
    CLOSED: [2021-01-16 Sat 01:57]
    =from Jian= This section is trivial for people have coding experience.
    Only some basic example to illustrate 
    1. write code with duplicate calls to a pure /function/.
    2. save duplicate calls to one variable, and use it multiple times.
    3. introduce a /closure/ which replaces the pure /function/,
       but again call it multiple times. =WHY=

*** DONE Closure Type Inference and Annotation - 269
    CLOSED: [2021-01-16 Sat 01:57]
    - /Type annotations/ are required on /functions/
      because they're part of an /explicit interface/ *exposed to* your users.
      Defining this interface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone
      agrees on what types of values a function uses and returns.
        But /closures/ *AREN'T used in an exposed interface* like this: they're
      stored in /variables/ and used without naming them and exposing them to
      users of our library.
      
    - Closure with type annotations (mostly not required and recommended):
      #+begin_src rust
        let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
            println!("calculating slowly...");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
            num
        }
      #+end_src

    - The curly braces are _optional_ if the closure body only has one line.

*** DONE Storing Closures Using Generic Parameters and the ~Fn~ Traits - 270
    CLOSED: [2021-01-16 Sat 02:32]
    Create a /struct/ and use memoization to *cache* this expensive calculation.
    #+begin_src rust
      struct Cacher<T>
      where
          T: Fn(u32) -> u32,
      {
          calculation: T,
          value: Option<u32>,
      }
    #+end_src
    
    - All /closures/ implement *at least one* of the /traits/:
      * ~Fn~
      * ~FnMut~
      * ~FnOnce~

    - Note:
      /Functions/ can implement *all three* of the ~Fn~ /traits/ too.
      * If what we want to do doesn't require capturing a value from the environment,
        we can use a /function/ rather than _a /closure/ where we need something that
        implements an ~Fn~ /trait/._

    - =NEXT=
      We'll discuss the difference between these /traits/ in the “Capturing the
      Environment with Closures” section;

    - In this example, we can use the ~Fn~ /trait/.

    - Implement methods for ~Cacher<T>~:
      #+begin_src rust
        impl<T> Cacher<T>
        where
            T: Fn(u32) -> u32,
        {
            fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T> {
                Cacher {
                    calculation,
                    value: None,
                }
            }

            fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {
                match self.value {
                    Some(v) => v,
                    None => {
                        let v = (self.calculation)(arg);
                        self.value = Some(v);
                        v
                    }
                }
            }
        }
      #+end_src
      
      Then we can write:
      #+begin_src rust
        fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
            let mut expensive_result = Cacher::new(|num| {
                println!("calculating slowly...");
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
                num
            });

            if intensity < 25 {
                println!("Today, do {} pushups!", expensive_result.value(intensity));
                println!("Next, do {} situps!", expensive_result.value(intensity));
            } else {
                if random_number == 3 {
                    println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
                } else {
                    println!("Today, run for {} minutes!", expensive_result.value(intensity));
                }
            }
        }
      #+end_src

*** DONE Limitations of the ~Cacher~ Implementation - 273
    CLOSED: [2021-01-16 Sat 03:12]
    There are *two problems* with the _current implementation_ of ~Cacher~ that
    would make reusing it in different contexts difficult.

    - Problem 1:
      _a ~Cacher~ instance_ *assumes* it will ALWAYS get the _same value_ for
      the parameter ~arg~ to the ~value~ /method/.
      #+begin_src rust
        // This test of `Cacher` will fail!
        #[test]
        fn call_with_different_values() {

            let v1 = c.value(1);
            let v2 = c.value(2);

            assert_eq!(v2, 2);
        }
      #+end_src
      * Try modifying ~Cacher~ to hold a /hash map/, from ~arg~'s of different
        calls to the result of calling the /closure/, rather than a SINGLE value.
        
      * The ~value~ /function/ will
        + look up the ~arg~ in the /hash map/ and return the value if it's present.

        + If it's not present,
          the ~Cacher~ will call the /closure/ and save the resulting value in
          the /hash map/ associated with its ~arg~ value.
          
      * =from Jian= New implementation:
        #+begin_src rust
          use std::collections::HashMap;

          struct Cacher<T>
          where
              T: Fn(u32) -> u32,
          {
              calculation: T,
              values: HashMap<u32, u32>,
          }

          impl<T> Cacher<T>
          where
              T: Fn(u32) -> u32,
          {
              fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T> {
                  Cacher {
                      calculation,
                      values: HashMap::new(),
                  }
              }

              fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {
                  match self.values.get(&arg) {
                      Some(v) => *v,
                      None => {
                          let v = (self.calculation)(arg);
                          self.values.insert(arg, v);
                          v

              }
          }
        #+end_src

    - Problem 2:
      * The current ~Cacher~ implementation is that it _only accepts_ /closures/
        that
        + TAKE one parameter of type ~u32~
        + RETURN a ~u32~.
      
      * We might want to cache the results of /closures/ that, for example,
        + TAKE a /string slice/
        + RETURN ~usize~ values,
          
        To fix this issue, =TODO=
        try INTRODUCING *more* /generic parameters/ to _INCREASE the flexibility_
        of the ~Cacher~ functionality.

*** DONE Capturing the Environment with Closures - 274
    CLOSED: [2021-01-16 Sat 03:34]
    - *Overhead* of captureing values from the /definition site environment/:
      * /closures/ use memory to *store* the _values for use in the /closure/
        body._

      * /functions/ are *NEVER allowed to capture* their environment, defining
        and using functions will *NEVER incur this _overhead_.*

    - _THREE ways (taking ownership, borrowing immutably, and borrowing
      mutably) of capturing values_ are encoded in the _THREE ~Fn~ traits_ as
      follows:
      * ~FnOnce~
        *takes* /ownership/ of the variables it captures from the environment and
        *moves* those variables *into* the /closure/ when the /closure/ is defined.

        + Therefore,
          a ~FnOnce~ /closure/ *cannot be called more than once* _in the SAME
          context_.
          
      * ~FnMut~ *can change* the environment since it *mutably borrows* values.

      * ~Fn~ *borrows* values from the environment _immutably_.

    - When you create a /closure/,
      Rust *infers* which /trait/ to use *based on* how the /closure/ uses the
      _values from the environment_. 
      * *ALL* /closures/ implement ~FnOnce~ because they can ALL _be called at
        least once_.

      * /Closures/ that *don't move* the _captured variables_ also implement
        ~FnMut~,

      * /Closures/ that *don't need mutable access* to the _captured variables_
        also implement ~Fn~.

    - If we want to FORCE the /closure/ to _take ownership_ of the values it uses
      in the environment, we can use the ~move~ keyword before the parameter
      list.
      _This is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread in order to
      move the data to be owned by the new thread._

      * =TODO=
        We'll have more examples of move closures in Chapter 16 when we talk
        about concurrency.

      * For now here's the code with the ~move~ /keyword/ added to the /closure/
        definition and using /vectors/ instead of /integers/, since /integers/
        can be /copied/ rather than /moved/:
        #+BEGIN_SRC rust
          // Listing 13-12: Example of a closure that refers to a variable in its enclosing scope

          fn main() {
              let x = vec![1, 2, 3];

              let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;

              println!("can't use x here: {:?}", x);

              let y = vec![1, 2, 3];

              assert!(equal_to_x(y));
          }
        #+END_SRC
        This *won't compile* because of the ~println!~ line.

    - Most of the time when specifying _one of the ~Fn~ /trait/ bounds,_

    - The Rust compiler can guide you how to pick a ~Fn~ /trait/:
      1. you can start with ~Fn~

      2. the compiler will tell you if you need ~FnMut~ or ~FnOnce~
         based on _what happens in the /closure/ body._

** DONE Processing a Series of Items with Iterators - 276
   CLOSED: [2021-01-16 Sat 23:42]
   The /iterator pattern/ allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items
   in turn.

   - An /iterator/ is responsible for the logic of
     ITERATING over each item and
     DETERMINING when the sequence has finished.
     * When you use /iterators/, you don't have to reimplement that logic yourself.

   - In Rust, *iterators are LAZY,* meaning they have no effect until you call
     /methods/ that consume the /iterator/ to use it up.
     * For example,
       #+begin_src rust
         let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
         let v1_iter = v1.iter();
       #+end_src

   - Example:
     #+begin_src rust
       let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
       let v1_iter = v1.iter();

          *returns* _OWNED values_,

      because calling them uses up the /iterator/.

     * Q :: What assembly code would this Rust code compile to?
     * A :: It compiles down to the same assembly you'd write by hand.
       + There's *no loop* at all corresponding to the iteration over the values
         in ~coefficients~:
         Rust knows that there are 12 iterations, so it “unrolls” the loop.
         /Unrolling/ is an optimization that removes the overhead of the loop
         controlling code and instead generates repetitive code for each
         iteration of the loop.

     * All of the ~coefficients~ get stored in /registers/,
       which means accessing the values is *very fast*.

     * There are no /bounds checks/ on the array access at runtime.

     * CONCLUSION:
       All these optimizations that Rust is able to apply make the resulting
       code extremely efficient.

   - Summary:
     *Now that you know this, you can use /iterators/ and /closures/ without fear!*
     They make code seem like it's higher level
     BUT *don't* impose a /runtime performance penalty/ for doing so.

** Summary - 289

* TODO 14. More About Cargo and Crates.io - 291 - =TODO= =publish=
  In this chapter, we'll discuss some of its other, more advanced features to
  show you how to do the following:
  * *Customize* your build through /release profiles/
  * *Publish* libraries *on* crates.io
  * *Organize* LARGE projects with /workspaces/
  * *Install* binaries *from* crates.io
  * *Extend* Cargo using _custom commands_

** DONE Customizing Builds with Release Profiles - 292
   CLOSED: [2021-01-17 Sun 00:27]
   In Rust, /release profiles/ are *predefined* and *customizable* /profiles/
   with different configurations that allow a programmer to have more control
   over various options for compiling code. Each profile is configured
   independently of the others.

   - Cargo has two MAIN /profiles/:
     * ~cargo build~ uses the ~dev~ /profile/
       + The ~dev~ /profile/ is defined with *good defaults for _DEVELOPMENT_.*

     * ~cargo build --release~ uses the ~release~ /profile/
       + the ~release~ /profile/ has *good defaults for _RELEASE_ builds.*

   - These /profile/ names might be familiar from the OUTPUT of your _builds_:
     * ~cargo build~: Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     * ~cargo build --release~: Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.0s

   - Cargo has *default settings* for each of the /profiles/ that apply
     when there aren't any ~[profile.*]~ sections in the project's =Cargo.toml=
     file.

   - By adding ~[profile.*]~ sections for any /profile/ you want to customize,
     you can *override* any subset of the _default settings_.
     * For example,
       here are the default values for the ~opt-level~ setting for the ~dev~ and
       ~release~ /profiles/:
       #+begin_src toml
         [profile.dev]
         opt-level = 0

         [profile.release]
         opt-level = 3
       #+end_src
       + ~opt-level~ controls the _number of optimizations_ Rust will apply to
         your code, with a *range of 0 to 3.*

   As your project develops, you might find that the /library crate/ continues to
   get bigger and you want to *split up* your /package/ further into _MULTIPLE
   /library crates/._
     In this situation, Cargo offers a feature called /workspaces/ that can help
   manage _MULTIPLE related packages_ that are developed in tandem.
   
*** DONE Creating a Workspace - 303
    CLOSED: [2021-01-17 Sun 01:27]
    Create a project named as =add=, which includes ONE /binary crate/ and TWO
    /library crates/. The /binary crate/, which will provide the _main
    functionality_, will depend on the TWO /libraries/: one provides a function
    ~add_one~, and the other one provides ~add_two~.
    
    - There are multiple ways to structure a workspace; =TODO= =???=
      we're going to show one common way.
      1. ~mkdir add~ and then ~cd add~

      2. Add =Cargo.toml=
         #+begin_src toml
           [workspace]

           members = [
               "adder",
           ]
         #+end_src

      3. ~cargo new adder~
         Then the project directory structure:
         #+begin_src text
           ├── Cargo.lock
           ├── Cargo.toml
           ├── adder

           │   └── src
           │       └── main.rs
           └── target
         #+end_src
         One /workspace/ has one =target= directory at the top level for the
         /compiled artifacts/ to be placed into;
         * EXAMPLE:
           =adder= doesn't have its own =target=, even if run ~cargo build~ just
           INSIDE =adder=.

         * RATIONALE:
           + The /crates/ in a /workspace/ are meant to depend on each other.
              =from Jian= If not, we shouldn't use /workspace/.

           + By sharing _ONE_ =target= directory, the /crates/ can *AVOID
             unnecessary rebuilding*:
             If each /crate/ had its own =target= directory, EACH /crate/ would
             have to *recompile* EACH of the other /crates/ in the /workspace/ to
             have the /artifacts/ in its own =target= directory.
    
*** DONE Creating the Second Package in the Workspace - 304

    Next, create another /member package/ in the /workspace/ and call it =add-one=.
    
    1. Change the top level =Cargo.toml=:
       #+begin_src toml
         [workspace]

         members = [
             "adder",
             "add-one",
         ]
       #+end_src

    2. ~cargo new add-one --lib~
       Then the project directory structure is like:
       #+begin_src text
         ├── Cargo.lock
         ├── Cargo.toml
         ├── add-one

         │       └── main.rs
         └── target
       #+end_src

    3. Add =add-one/src/lib.rs=
       #+begin_src rust
         pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
             x + 1
         }
       #+end_src
       
    4. Edit the =adder/Cargo.toml=:
       #+begin_src toml
         [dependencies]

         add-one = { path = "../add-one" }
       #+end_src
       Cargo does *NOT assume* that /crates/ in a /workspace/ will depend on each
       other, so we need to be explicit about the dependency relationships
       between the /crates/.
       * =from Jian=
         I think this is reasonable, if assue this,
         *circular dependency will be introduced AUTOMATICALLY*.

    5. Use the ~add_one~ function from the =add-one= /crate/.
       #+begin_src rust
         // adder/src/main.rs

         use add_one;

         fn main() {
             let num = 10;
             println!(
                 "Hello, world! {} plus one is {}!",
                 num,
                 add_one::add_one(num)
             );
         }
       #+end_src

     6. We can ~cargo build~, and then ~cargo run -p adder~.
        * The ~-p~ flag specifies which /package/ in the /workspace/ we want to run.
       
**** DONE Depending on an External Package in a Workspace - 305

     - Example:
       ~add_one~ depends on ~rand~.
       Then add ~rand~ to the =[dependencies]= section of =add-one/Cargo.toml=.
       
     - /Crates/ in the SAME /workspace/ doesn't share dependencies.
       If =adder/src/main.rs= wants to use ~rand~, then edit =adder/Cargo.toml=.

     - Building the =adder= /package/ will *add* ~rand~ to the list of /dependencies/
       for =adder= in =Cargo.lock=, but *no additional copies of =rand= will be
       downloaded*.
       
       * Cargo has *ensured* that EVERY /crate/ in EVERY /package/ in the /workspace/
         using the ~rand~ /package/ *will be using the _SAME version_.*
         + This

        As your project grows, consider using a /workspace/:
        * it's easier to understand smaller, individual components than one big
          blob of code.
        * Furthermore, keeping the /crates/ in a /workspace/ can *make coordination

   Cargo is designed so you can _extend it with new subcommands_
   *WITHOUT having to modify* Cargo.

   - If a binary in your ~$PATH~ is named ~cargo-something~,
     you can run it *as if it was a Cargo subcommand* by running ~cargo something~.

   - /Custom commands/ like this are also *listed* when you run ~cargo --list~.

   - Being able to use ~cargo install~ to install extensions and then run them just
     like the built-in Cargo tools is a super convenient benefit of Cargo's

* TODO 15. Smart Pointers - 311
  - /pointer/ :: a generic programming term for something that refers to a
                 location that stores some other data.

  - /smart pointers/ :: data structures that
    * act like a pointer
    * have additional metadata and capabilities, such as /reference counting/.

  - The /smart pointers/ pattern originated in C++.

  - In Rust, an additional difference between /plain references/ and
    /smart pointers/ is that
    * /references/ are a kind of pointer that ONLY borrow data;
    * by contrast, in many cases, /smart pointers/ own the data that they point to.

  - We've actually already encountered a few smart pointers in this book,
    even though we didn't call them that by name at the time.

    For example, ~String~ and ~Vec<T>~ are both /smart pointers/.

  - /smart pointers/
    * _own_ some memory and allow you to manipulate it,
    * have
      + metadata (like their /capacity/)
      + extra capabilities or guarantees (~String~ data will always be valid UTF-8).

  - The characteristics that distinguish a /smart pointer/ from an
    /ordinary struct/ are:
    /smart pointers/ implement the ~Deref~ and ~Drop~ traits, and in this chapter
    we'll be discussing both of those traits and why they're important to smart pointers.
    =TODO= _in this chapter_

  - There won't be complete coverage of all the features of the /smart pointer/
    pattern.

    The ones we cover here are the most common ones from the standard library:
    * ~Box<T>~, for allocating values on the /heap/.

    * ~Rc<T>~, a reference counted type so data can have multiple owners
      (=From Jian= as I know, reference count can solve /circular reference/
      =double check here=).

    * ~RefCell<T>~, which isn't a /smart pointer/ itself, but manages access to
      the /smart pointers/ ~Ref~ and ~RefMut~ to enforce the borrowing rules
      _at runtime_ instead of compile time.

    Along the way, we'll also cover:
    * The /interior mutability/ pattern where an immutable type exposes an API
      for mutating an interior value, and the borrowing rules apply _at runtime_
      instead of compile time.

    * Reference cycles, how they can leak memory, and how to prevent them.

   - The ~Deref~ allows us to override ~*~ (the dereference operator).

   - Override ~*~ for smart pointers makes accessing the data behind the smart
     pointer convenient.
     * With /references/ that are _NOT_ /smart pointers/, there's _only one_
       value that the reference is pointing to, so the dereference operation is
       straightforward.

     * /Smart pointers/ can also store metadata about the pointer of the data.

       We usually do ONLY want the data, NOT the metadata. If we don't override
       the ~*~ (through implementing the ~Deref~ trait), we need to manually
       strip out the metadata.

   - =Review= /dereference operator/ was mentioned in Chapter 8.

   - =TODO= =TODO=
     The ~type Target = T;~ syntax is defining an /associated type/, which is
     covered in more detail in _Chapter 19_. Don't worry about that part of the
     example too much; it is a slightly different way of declaring a generic
     parameter.

   - In order to get a ~&~ reference that ~*~ can dereference, the compiler
     expands ~*my_favorite_song~ to:
     ~*(my_favorite_song.deref())~

     * Rust tends to favor _explicitness_ over _implicitness_.

       One exception: /deref coercions/ of arguments to functions and methods.

     * A /deref coercion/ will automatically convert a reference to any pointer
       into a reference to that pointer's contents.

     * A /deref coercion/ happens when the reference type of the argument passed
       into the function _differs_ from the reference type of the parameter
       defined in that function's signature.

     * /Deref coercion/ was added to Rust to make calling functions and methods
       _NOT_ need as many explicit references and dereferences with ~&~ and ~*~.

     * Example:
       #+BEGIN_SRC rust
         fn compress_mp3(audio: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
             // the actual implementation would go here
         }

         // If there is NOT *deref coercions*, we need
         compress_mp3(my_favorite_song.audio.as_slice());

         // Luckily that we have *deref coercions*
         compress_mp3(&my_favorite_song);
       #+END_SRC

     * Similar to how we use the ~Deref~ trait to override ~*~ on ~&T~'s, there is
       also a ~DerefMut~ trait for overriding ~*~ on ~&mut T~.

     * Rust does /deref coercion/ when it finds types and trait implementations in
       _three_ cases:
       + From ~&T~ to ~&U~ when ~T: Deref<Target=U>~.
       + From ~&mut T~ to ~&mut U~ when ~T: DerefMut<Target=U>~.

      * We are also NOT allowed to call ~Drop::drop~ directly because Rust inserts

   - Sometimes, you may actually need multiple owners.

   - ~Rc<T>~ is for use when we want to allocate some data on the /heap/ for
     multiple parts of our program to read, and we _CANNOT_ determine at compile
     time which part of our program using this data will finish using it last.

      of the data and the normal ownership rules enforced at compile time would
      kick in

      I think
      If we only know the last owner, and we don't know the order of operations,

    - The ~clone~ method of the ~Rc<T>~ dosen't make a full copy, and it just
      increase the /reference count/.

    - Use ~Rc::strong_count~ to returns the /reference count/.
      For example,

      go out of their scopes.

    - ~Rc<T>~ only allows you to share data for multiple parts of your program to
      read through _immutable references_ to the ~T~ value the ~Rc<T>~ contains.

      This follows the requirement mentioned in Chapter 4:

      _But_ with ~RefCell<T>~, we use the ~borrow~ and ~borrow_mut~ methods, which

* TODO 17. Object-Oriented Programming Features of Rust - 371
  - Object-Oriented Programming is a way of modeling programs that originated
    with *Simula* in the 1960s and became popular with *C++* in the 1990s.
    =From Jian= The milestones should be mentioned: *Smalltalk* and *Java*.

  - There are many _competing definitions_ for what OOP is:
    * under some definitions, Rust is object-oriented;
    * under other definitions, Rust is not.

    =From Jian= Let's see which parts is the good parts in OOP in Rust's point of
    view.

  - In this chapter, we'll explore
    * some characteristics that are commonly considered to be object-oriented.
    * how those characteristics translate to idiomatic Rust.

** DONE Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages - 371
   CLOSED: [2017-08-30 Wed 21:26]
   There isn't consensus in the programming community about the features a
   language needs to have in order to be called object-oriented.

*** DONE Objects Contain Data and Behavior - 372
    CLOSED: [2017-08-30 Wed 20:53]
    - "The Gang of Four book" defines OOP in this way:
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Object-oriented programs are made up of /objects/.

       An object _packages_ both data and the procedures that operate on that
       data.

       The procedures are typically called /methods/ or /operations/.
       #+END_QUOTE

    - In Rust, /structs/ provide the same functionality as of /objects/, though
      we don't call them /objects/.

*** DONE Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Details - 372
    CLOSED: [2017-08-30 Wed 21:09]
    - /encapsulation/ :: the implementation details of an object aren't
         accessible to code using that object.

    - The public API is important. If the code is well encapsulated, and
      the API is fixed, it should let user fill the internal change when
      only considering the results (of course, things like speed can change).

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        pub struct AveragedCollection {
            list: Vec<i32>,
            average: f64,
        }

        impl AveragedCollection {
            pub fn add(&mut self, value: i32) {
                self.list.push(value);
                self.update_average();
            }

            pub fn remove(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
                let result = self.list.pop();
                match result {
                    Some(value) => {
                        self.update_average();
                        Some(value)
                    },
                    None => None,
                }
            }

            pub fn average(&self) -> f64 {
                self.average
            }

            fn update_average(&mut self) {
                let total: i32 = self.list.iter().sum();
                self.average = total as f64 / self.list.len() as f64;
            }
        }
      #+END_SRC

      + The fields of ~AveragedCollection~ are private by default.
        The are not parts of the public API the object offers.

      + The public API are the parts with ~pub~ keywords.

      + Since the inner data structure is not a part of the public API, we can
        later change the type of the field ~list~ to the type of HashSet.

        As long as the signature of the ~add~, ~remove~, and ~average~ stay the
        same, code using ~AveragedCollection~ wouldn't need to change.

      + If we expose the ~list~ as public API (with ~pub~), not only the data
        structure change can change the API, but also the public API of the new
        data structure of the ~list~ is mixed into the public API.

        This can completely destory the /encapsulation/:
        * different type has different opertions.
        * detials that doesn't follow any common contract become parts of the
          public API.

        The result is all the code using ~AveragedCollection~ may need to be
        changed.

*** DONE Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing - 374 =RE-READ=
    CLOSED: [2017-08-30 Wed 21:26]
    - Rust doesn't support /inheritance/.
      However, Rust use /traits/ (=From Jian= and /enums/, which I think should
      be mentioned in this section, though it is NOT) to do

    - While many people use "polymorphism" to describe inheritance, it's actually
      a specific kind of polymorphism, called "sub-type polymorphism."

      There are other forms as well;

      a generic parameter with a trait bound in Rust is also polymorphism, more
      specifically "parametric polymorphism."

      The exact details between the different kinds of polymorphism aren't
      crucial here (=TODO= =From Jian= BUT I want to know), so don't worry too
      much about the details:
      just know that
      _Rust has multiple polymorphism-related features, unlike many OOP languages_.
      =TODO=

** TODO Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Differnt Types - 375
   =RE-READ=
   /enums/ is a way we can use to hold some variants, and use them as one
   single data type.

   This is useful, but not enough -- it is closed, and we can't add variants
   to an /enum/ after its definition.

   /traits/ is a way to get rid of the _closed_ feature of /enums/.

   Example: In a GUI library, a lot of /structs/ need a ~draw~ method. We don't
   know how many /structs/ we have -- acutally, the number can increase.
   /enums/ CANNOT help, but /taits/ can.


*** DONE Defining a Trait for the Common Behavior - 375
    CLOSED: [2017-08-30 Wed 22:22]
    - In Rust, though, we can define a trait that we'll name ~Draw~ and that will
      have one method named ~draw~. Then we can define a vector that takes a
      /trait object/, which is _a trait behind some sort of pointer_, such as a
      ~&~ reference or a ~Box<T>~ smart pointer.

    - =TODO= We'll talk about the reason trait objects have to be behind a
      pointer in Chapter 19.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        // src/lib.rs

        pub trait Draw {
            fn draw(&self);
        }

        pub struct Screen {
            pub components: Vec<Box<Draw>>,
        }

        impl Screen {
            pub fn run(&self) {
                for component in self.components.iter() {
                    component.draw();
                }
            }
        }
      #+END_SRC

      In the below code, the ~components~ can only be a _homogeneous_
      collections, which is not required in the above code:
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        pub struct Screen<T: Draw> {
            pub components: Vec<T>,
        }

        impl Screen<T>
            where T: Draw {
            pub fn run(&self) {
                for component in self.components.iter() {
                    component.draw();

*** DONE Trait Objects Perform Dynamic Dispatch - 380
    CLOSED: [2017-08-30 Wed 22:43]
    - The code that results from /monomorphization/ is doing static dispatch:
      when the method is called, the code that goes with that method call
      _has been determined_ at compile time, and looking up that code is very
      _FAST_.

    - When we use trait objects, the compiler can't perform /monomorphization/.
      Rust can figure it out when a method is called at /runtime/ (of course,
      there is runtime cost).
        This is called /dynamic dispatch/.

    - Dynamic dispatch also _prevents_ the compiler from choosing to /inline/ a
      method's code, which _prevents some optimizations_.

      Tradeoff between performance (extra runtime cost) and extra flexibility.

*** TODO Object Safety is Required for Trait Objects - 380 =RE-READ= =HARD=
    =MORE EXAMPLES REQUIRED=
    NOT all /traits/ can be made into /trait objects/; ONLY /object safe/
    /traits/ can.

    - The requirements of /object safe/:
      + The trait does NOT require ~Self~ to be ~Sized~
      + All of the trait's methods are /object safe/.

    - ~Self~ :: a keyword that is an alias for the type that we're implementing
                traits or methods on.

    - ~Sized~ :: a marker trait like the ~Send~ and ~Sync~ traits that we talked
                 about in Chapter 16 =TODO=.

    - ~Sized~ is automatically implemented on types that have a known size at
      compile time, such as ~i32~ and references.

      Types that do NOT have a known size include slices(~[T]~) and
      /trait objects/.

    - ~Sized~ is an implicit trait bound on all generic type parameters by
      default. Most useful operations in Rust require a type to be ~Sized~, so
      making ~Sized~ a default requirement on trait bounds means we don't have
      to write ~T: Sized~ with most every use of generics. If we want to be able
      to use a trait on slices, however, we need to opt out of the ~Sized~ trait
      bound, and we can do that by specifying ~T: ?Sized~ as a trait bound.
      =TODO=

    - /supertraits/ =TODO= CHAPTER 19

    - The reason a trait like ~Foo~ that requires ~Self~ to be ~Sized~ is
      _NOT allowed_ to be a /trait object/ is that it would be impossible to
      implement the trait ~Foo~ for the /trait object/ ~Foo~:
      /trait objects/ are NOT sized, but ~Foo~ requires ~Self~ to be ~Sized~.

      _A type can't be both sized and unsized at the same time!_

    - A method is /object safe/ if either:
      * It requires ~Self~ to be ~Sized~ or

      * It meets _ALL_ three of the following:
        + It _MUST NOT_ have any generic type parameters

        + Its first argument _MUST_ be
          - of type ~Self~
            or
          - a type that dereferences to the ~Self~ type (that is, it must be a
            method rather than an associated function and have ~self~, ~&self~,
            or ~&mut self~ as the first argument)

        + It _MUST NOT_ use ~Self~ anywhere else in the signature except for the
          first argument.

** DONE Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match - 401
   CLOSED: [2017-08-30 Wed 01:10]
   - Patterns come in _two_ forms:
     + /refutable/: patterns which can fail to match for some possible value.

     + /irrefutable/: patterns which CANNOT fail to match for any possible value.

   - ~let~ statements, function parameters, and ~for~ loops are restricted to
     _ONLY accept_ /irrefutable patterns/,

     since there's nothing correct the program could do if the pattern fails to
     match.

   - ~if let~, and ~while let~ expressions are restricted to _ONLY accept_
     /refutable patterns/,

     since they're made to handle possible failure and we wouldn't need their
     functionality if the pattern could never fail.

   - When we use these two concepts, nothing complicated.

     What we really need to know is that when these concepts show up in an error
     message, which should know what do they mean.

   - For example,
     #+BEGIN_SRC rust
       let Some(x) = some_option_value; // Can be `None`

       // error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `None` not covered

    - Named variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value.
      For example, if an arm of ~match~ is ~Some(y)~, here ~y~ is the named
      variables.

    - In order to make a ~match~ expression that compares the values of the outer
      ~x~ and ~y~ rather than introducing a shadowed variable, we would need to
      use a /match guard/ conditional instead.

          Some(x) => println!("{}", x),
          None => (),
      }
    #+END_SRC

    - Example (fight against shadowning):
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        fn main() {
            let x = Some(5);
            let y = 10;

            match x {
                Some(50) => println!("Got 50"),
                Some(n) if n == y => println!("Matched, n = {:?}", n),

      #+END_SRC

      The ~y~ shows up ONLY in the guard part, which makes it clear that this ~y~
      should be the one in the outside scope.

      =NOTE= You definitely cannot write like ~Some(y) if y == y => ...~.

    - Example (guard that should be applied to all the ~|~ separated patterns):
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
        // let x = 4;
        // let y = false;

        match x {
            4 | 5 | 6 if y => println!("yes"),
            _ => println!("no"),

      #+END_SRC

      In other words,
      + it is ~(4 | 5 | 6) if y => ...~
      + it is NOT ~4 | 5 | (6 if y) => ...~, though this is NOT compilable.

    - If you just want to use guard when only part of the ~|~ patterns match,
      just split and re-group the patterns.

    - The first arm:
      we bind the exact value of the ~id~ of ~msg~ to the ~id~ after ~:~, and
      also test if it is in the range of ~3...7~.

    - The second arm:
