* PART 2 Functional-Style Data Processing with Streams - 79
  - The second part of this book is a _DEEP EXPLORATION of the new Streams API_,
    which lets you write powerful code that processes a /collection/ of data _in
    a declarative way_.

  - TARGET:
    By the end of this second part, you'll have a full understanding of
    + *WHAT* /streams/ are
    + *HOW* you can use them in your codebase to process a /collection/ of data
      _concisely_ and _efficiently_.

  - Each chapters:
    + Chapter 4
      * INTRODUCES the *concept* of a /stream/
      * EXPLAINS *how* it _compares with_ a /collection/.

    + Chapter 5
      _investigates in detail_ the /stream operations/ available to express
      sophisticated data processing queries.
        You'll look at many *patterns* such as /filtering/, /slicing/, /finding/,
      /matching/, /mapping/, and /reducing/.

    + Chapter 6
      covers /collectors/ -- a feature of the /Streams API/ that lets you express
      _even MORE COMPLEX_ data processing queries.

    + In chapter 7
      you'll learn about *how* /streams/ can *automatically run in parallel* and
      leverage your multicore architectures.
        In addition, you'll learn about *various pitfalls to avoid* _WHEN using
      /parallel streams/ CORRECTLY and EFFECTIVELY_.

* DONE 4 Introducing streams - 81
  CLOSED: [2018-06-20 Wed 18:24]
  - This chapter covers
    + WHAT is a /stream/?
    + /Collections/ _vs._ /streams/
    + /Internal iteration/ _vs._ /external iteration/
    + /Intermediate operations/ _vs._ /terminal operations/

  - But despite collections being necessary for almost any Java application,
    manipulating collections is far from perfect:

    + Recall that you did a lot of business logic entails database-like operations
      such as /grouping/ or /finding/, and you had manually reimplemented these
      operations again and again.

      * Expectation ::
        Use these functionalities in a declarative way.

        =From Jian=  Extra /methods/ and /data structures/ required.

        =From Jian=
        An IMPLICIT Requirement (due to performance):
        You may hope to write the code in a style of step by step processing, but
        the operations should be composed in the background, and then with less
        pass (usually 1 pass) do all the operations. This requirement is acutally
        /laziness/!

    + Suppose you need to process a LARGE /collection/ of elements.

      * Expectation ::
        Process them in parallel and leverage multicore architectures _to gain
        PERFORMANCE_.

      * Obstacle ::
        - _WRITING *parallel code* is COMPLICATED_
          in comparison to working with /iterators/.

        - It's no fun to _DEBUG_!

  - The answer that can fulfill the requirements above is /stream/'s.

** DONE 4.1 What are streams? - 81
   CLOSED: [2018-06-20 Wed 19:18]
   - For now
     you can think of /streams/ as FANCY /iterators/ over a /collection/ of data.

     In addition,
     /streams/ can be processed IN PARALLEL _transparently_, *without* you having
     to write any multithreaded code!

     =TODO=
     More details in chapter 7 how /streams/ and /parallelization/ work.

   - Example:
     You have a ~menu~, and you want to return the names of dishes that are low
     in calories, sorted by number of calories.

     + Before (Java 7):
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         List<Dish> lowCaloricDishes = new ArrayList<>();

         for(Dish d: menu){
             if(d.getCalories() < 400){
                 lowCaloricDishes.add(d);
             }
         }

         Collections.sort(lowCaloricDishes, new Comparator<Dish>() {
                 public int compare(Dish d1, Dish d2){
                     return Integer.compare(d1.getCalories(), d2.getCalories());
                 }
             });

         List<String> lowCaloricDishesName = new ArrayList<>();

         for(Dish d: lowCaloricDishes){
             lowCaloricDishesName.add(d.getName());
         }
       #+END_SRC
       * Garbage variable ~lowCaloricDishes~, whoes ONLY purpose is to act as an
         intermediate throwaway container.

     + Java 8+:
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
         import static java.util.Comparator.comparing;
         import static java.util.stream.Collectors.toList;

         // non-parallel version
         List<String> lowCaloricDishesName =
             menu.stream()
             .filter(d -> d.getCalories() < 400)
             .sorted(comparing(Dish::getCalories))
             .map(Dish::getName)
             .collect(toList());

         // parallel version
         List<String> lowCaloricDishesName =
             menu.parallelStream()
             .filter(d -> d.getCalories() < 400)
             .sorted(comparing(Dish::getCalories))
             .map(Dish::getName)
             .collect(toList());
       #+END_SRC
       * =TODO=
         More detail about the ~.parallelStream()~ method in Chapter 7.
         - How many threads are being used?
         - What are the performance benefits?

       * Several immediate benefits (compare to the old method):
         - Declarative way.

         - Express in the style of a pipeline.
           NO intermediate throwaway container.

       * The operations such as ~filter~ are available as *high-level building
         blocks* that do *NOT depend on* a SPECIFIC /threading model/ -- their
         internal implementation could be single-threaded OR potentially maximize
         your multicore architecture transparently!

   - Other libraries: /Guava/, /Apache Commons/, and /lambdaj/ of this style,
     which are written far before Java 8.

   - To summarize, the _Streams API_ in Java 8 lets you write code that's
     + Declarative -- More concise and readable
     + Composable -- Greater flexibility
     + Parallelizable -- Better performance

   - =TODO= in this book
     + We'll compare streams to collections and provide some background.

     + In the next chapter,
       * we'll investigate in detail the stream operations available to express
         sophisticated data processing queries.

       * We'll look at many patterns such as filtering, slicing, finding, matching,
         mapping, and reducing. There will be many quizzes and exercises to try
         to solidify your understanding.

     + Next,
       we'll discuss how you can *create* and *manipulate* /numeric streams/,
       for example, to generate a /stream/ of even numbers or Pythagorean
       triples!

     + Finally,
       * we'll discuss how you can *create* /streams/ from different sources
         such as from a /file/.

       * We'll also discuss HOW TO *generate* /streams/ with an *INFINITE* number
         of elements -- something you definitely _CAN'T do with collections_!

** TODO 4.2 Getting started with streams - 86
   - We start our discussion of /streams/ with /collections/.
     This is the simplest way -- /collections/ in Java 8 support a new ~stream~
     /method/ that returns a /stream/ (from /interface/ ~java.util.stream.Stream~).

   - You'll later see that you can also get /streams/ _in various OTHER ways_
     (for example, generating /stream/ elements FROM a /numeric range/ or FROM
     /I/O resources/).

* PART 6 Functional Programming and Future Java Evolution - 443
  A tutorial introduction to *writing effective functional-style programs in
  Java*, along with a comparison of Java 8 features with those of Scala.

  - Chapter 18
    gives a full tutorial on functional programming
    + introduces some of its terminology
    + explains how to write functional-style programs in Java.

  - Chapter 19
    covers more advanced functional programming techniques including
    + higher-order functions
    + currying
    + persistent data structures
    + lazy lists
    + pattern matching.

  - Chapter 20
    follows by discussing *how Java 8 features compare to features in the Scala
    language* -- a language that, like Java, is implemented on top of the JVM
    and that has evolved quickly to threaten some aspects of Java's niche in the
    programming language ecosystem.

  - Chapter 21
    reviews the journey of learning about Java 8 and the gentle push toward
    functional-style programming.

    In addition, we speculate on *what future enhancements* and *great new
    features* may be in Java's pipeline beyond Java 8 and Java 9.
