   - REST :: Representation State Transfer

   - /REST/ is a _technical description_ of HOW the /World Wide Web/ works.

   - If the Web is said to have an "OS", its _architectural_ STYLE is /REST/.

   - REST Application Programming Interface (REST API) ::
        The API of _a type of web server_ that enables a client, either
        user-operated or automated, to access resources that model a system's
        data and functions in a specific style.

        =from Jian= This sentence in the book is NOT clear, and seems wrong even
        in semantics (not reasonable)! =TODO= =Re-visit=

   - _THIS_ book is a *REST API designer's _style guide_ and _reference_.*
     It proposes a set of rules that you can leverage to design and develop REST
     APIs.

   - Upon analysis, Fielding recognized that the Web's *scalability* was _governed
     by_ a set of key *CONSTRAINTS*. Fielding grouped into _SIX_ categories and
     collectively referred to as the Web's architectural style:
     1. Client-server
     2. Uniform interface
     3. Layered system
     4. Cache
     5. Stateless
     6. Code-on-demand

** DONE URIs - 11
   CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:07]
   - REST APIs use /Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)/ to ADDRESS _resources_.

   - URI Design:
     + GOOD:
       http://api.example.restapi.org/france/paris/louvre/leonardo-da-vinci/mona-lisa

     + BAD:
       http://api.example.restapi.org/68dd0-a9d3-11e0-9f1c-0800200c9a66

   - A note about the _opacity of URIs_ in Tim Berners-Lee's "Axioms of Web
     Architecture" list:
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The only thing you can use an identifier for is to refer to an object. When
     you are not dereferencing, you should not look at the contents of the URI
     string to gain other information.
                    -- Tim Berners-Lee http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html
     #+END_QUOTE

   - =TODO= Chapter 5 discussion.

   - =TODO= This Chapter
     Introduce a set of _design rules_ for _REST API URIs_.

** DONE URI Format - 11
   CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:38]
   - URI syntax (RFC 3986) =TODO= =READ=
     ~URI := scheme "://" authority "/" path [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]~

*** DONE Rule: Forward slash separator (/) must be used to indicate a hierarchical relationship - 12
    CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:13]
    - ~/~ must be used to indicate a _hierarchical relationship_ BETWEEN _resources_.

*** DONE Rule: A trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs - 12
    CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:22]
    - The trailing ~/~
      + adds NO semantic value
        and
      + may cause confusion.

    - It's always better to assign one identifier to one resource.

      There is no reason to use two URIs (one without trailing ~/~ and one with
      trailing ~/~) to identify one resource.

    - A /sever/ *should NEVER* generate or communicate URIs with trailing ~/~ with
      its /clients/.

    - However, usually, /servers/ should have trailing ~/~ tolerance -- redirect
      the trailing ~/~ URI to the resource located by the non-trailing one.
      =TODO= Rule 301

*** DONE Rule: Hyphens (-) should be used to improve the readability of URIs - 12
    CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:24]
    To improve readability,
    anywhere you would use a space or hyphen in English,
    you should use a hyphen in a /URI/.

*** DONE Rule: Underscores (_) should not be used in URIs - 12
    CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:24]
    It can be partially obscured or completely hidden by _underlining_, which is
    often used by the browsers or editors to mark clickable links, including URIs.

    Either _partially obscured_ or _completely hidden_ depends on SPECIFIC *font settings*.

*** DONE Rule: Lowercase letters should be preferred in URI paths - 13
    CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:29]
    When convenient, lowercase letters are preferred in /URI/ paths
    _since capital letters can sometimes cause problems._

    - RFC 3986 defines URIs as *case-sensitive*
      _EXCEPT FOR_ the /scheme/ and /host components/.

    - For example:
      1. http://api.example.restapi.org/my-folder/my-doc
      2. HTTP://API.EXAMPLE.RESTAPI.ORG/my-folder/my-doc
      3. http://api.example.restapi.org/My-Folder/my-doc

      1 is prefered!

      1 and 2 are considered to be identical,
      according to _the URI format specification (RFC 3986)_.

      3 is *DIFFERENT* from 1 and 2, which may cause unnecessary confusion.

*** DONE Rule: File extensions should not be included in URIs - 13
    CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:36]
    Rely on the /media type/, rather then a extension after a period (~.~), as
    communicated through the ~Content-Type~ header, to determine how to process
    the body's content.

    - =TODO= "Media Types" on page 39. =TODO=

    - NOTES: =TODO= =TODO=
      *To enable _simple links_ and _easy debugging_,*
      a REST API may _SUPPORT_ *media type selection* VIA a *query parameter*
      as discussed in the section
      _“Rule: Media type selection using a query parameter may be suppor- ted”
      on page 44._

** DONE URI Authority Design - 14
   CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:46]
   This section covers the _naming conventions_ that should be used for the
   /authority/ portion of a REST API.

*** DONE Rule: Consistent subdomain names should be used for your APIs - 14
    CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:43]
    - The /top-level domain/ and /first subdomain/ names (e.g., ~soccer.restapi.org~)
      of an API should identify its *service owner*. =TODO= =???= =???=

    - The /full domain name of an API/ should add a /subdomain named ~api~./
      For example: http://api.soccer.restapi.org

*** DONE Rule: Consistent subdomain names should be used for your client developer portal - 14
    CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:46]
    Many /REST APIs/ have an _associated website_, known as a /developer portal/,
    to help onboard new clients with documentation, forums, and self-service
    provisioning of secure API access keys.

      If an API provides a /developer portal/, by convention it should have a
    _subdomain labeled developer_. For example: http://developer.soccer.restapi.org

** DONE Resource Modeling - 14
   CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 18:37]
   *Each segment separated by a ~/~ should be a resource.*

** TODO Resource Archetypes - 15
   - When modeling an /API's resources/,
     we can start with the some _basic_ /resource archetypes/.

   - A REST API is *composed of 4* DISTINCT /resources archetypes/:
     + /document/
     + /collection/
     + /store/
     + /controller/

   - *CAUTION*
     _Chapter 5_

** DONE URI Path Design - 16
   CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 02:47]
*** DONE Rule: A singular noun should be used for document names - 17
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 02:36]
    - Example (a single player document):
      http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams/trebuchet/players/claudio

*** DONE Rule: A plural noun should be used for collection names - 17
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 02:38]
    - Example:
      http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/seattle/teams/trebuchet/players

*** DONE Rule: A plural noun should be used for store names - 17
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 02:38]
    - Example:
      http://api.music.restapi.org/artists/mikemassedotcom/playlists

*** DONE Rule: A verb or verb phrase should be used for controller names - 17
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 02:39]
    - Examples:
      http://api.college.restapi.org/students/morgan/register

      http://api.ognom.restapi.org/dbs/reindex
      http://api.build.restapi.org/qa/nightly/runTestSuite

*** TODO Rule: Variable path segments may be substituted with identity-based values - 18 =RE-READ=
*** DONE Rule: CRUD function names should not be used in URIs - 18
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 02:45]
    - /URIs/ *should NOT be* used to indicate that a /CRUD function/ is performed.

      /URIs/ *should be* used to uniquely identify resources, and they should be
      named as described in the rules above.

    - =TODO=
      As discussed in "Request Methods" on page 23, =TODO=
      /HTTP request methods/ should be used to indicate which /CRUD function/ is
      performed.

      + This API interaction design is preferred:
        ~DELETE /users/1234~

      + Anti-patterns - What NOT to do:
        ~GET /deleteUser?id=1234~
        ~GET /deleteUser/1234~
        ~DELETE /deleteUser/1234~
        ~POST /users/1234/delete~

** TODO URI Query Design - 19
   - ??? =TODO=

   - ??? =TODO=

*** DONE Rule: The query component of a URI may be used to filter collections or stores - 19
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 02:54]
    - A /URI's query component/ is a natural fit for supplying search criteria to
      a collection or store.

    - Example:
      + ~GET /users~
      + A /query/ as _the filter criteria_: ~GET /users?role=admin~

*** TODO Rule: The query component of a URI should be used to paginate collection or store results - 20

* TODO 3. Interaction Design with HTTP - 23
** DONE HTTP/1.1 - 23
   CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 03:00]
   - /REST APIs/ embrace *ALL* aspects of the /HyperText Transfer Protocol/,
     version 1.1 (HTTP/1.1) including its
     + request methods
     + response codes
     + message headers

   - This book _DIVIDES_ its coverage of HTTP between *two* chapters,
     + with this chapter discussing /request methods/ and /response status codes/.

     + Incorporating /metadata/ in a /REST API design/, with /HTTP's request/ and
       /response headers/, is the subject of Chapter 4.

   - Tips:
     A few examples in this chapter use /curl/.
     It has some advantages over the browser:
     + /curl/ allows _easy access_ to HTTP's full feature set
       and

     + /curl/ is _scriptable_, meaning that programmers can write simple _shell
       scripts_ or _batch files_ containing /curl/ commands to *test* or *use* a
       /REST API/.

** TODO Request Methods - 23
   Clients specify the desired /interaction method/ in the ~Request-Line~ part =TODO=
   of an HTTP request message. _RFC 2616_ defines /the ~Request-Line~ syntax/ as
   shown below: *Request-Line \equiv{} Method SP Requiest-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF*

   - Each /HTTP method/ has specific, well-defined semantics within the context of a /REST
     API's resource model/.
     + ~GET~:
       *retrieve* a /representation/ of a _resource's state_.

     + ~HEAD~:
       *retrieve* the /metadata/ associated with the _resource's state_.

     + ~PUT~:
       *add* a NEW /resource/ to a store or *update* a /resource/.

     + ~DELETE~:
       *remove* a /resource/ _from its parent_.

     + ~POST~:
       should be used to
       * *create* a NEW /resource/ _within a collection_
         OR
       * *execute* /controllers/.

*** TODO Rule: ~GET~ and ~POST~ must not be used to tunnel other request methods - 24
*** TODO Rule: ~GET~ must be used to retrieve a representation of a resource - 24
*** TODO Rule: ~HEAD~ should be used to retrieve response headers - 25

*** DONE Rule: 200 ("OK") should be used to indicate nonspecific success - 28
    CLOSED: [2018-11"09"Fri 22:12]
    In most cases, _"00" is the code the client hopes to see.

    - _200_ indicate" t"at the REST API _SUCCESSFULLY carried out whatever action
      the client req"es"ed_,

    - UNLIKE _204_, "20"_ response SHOULD include a /response body/.

*** DONE Rule: 200 ("OK") must not be used to communicate errors in the response body - 28

*** DONE Rule: 303 ("See Other") should be used to refer the client to a different URI - 30
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 22:20]
    The _301_ status code indicates that the /REST API's resource model/ has been
    _significantly redesigned_ and a _new permanent URI has been assigned to the
    client’s requested resource_.

    The REST API should specify _the *new* URI_ in the response's ~Location~ /header/.

*** DONE Rule: 400 ("Bad Request") may be used to indicate nonspecific failure - 30
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 22:26]
    _400_ is the _GENERIC client-side error status_,
    sed when no other _4xx_ error code is appropriate.
    =from Jian= A fall back choice!

    - Tips: =TODO=
      For errors in the _4xx_ category, the /response body/ may contain a
      document describing the client's error (UNLESS the /request method/ was
      ~HEAD~ ).

      =TODO=
      See “Error Representation” on page 68 for error response body design.

*** DONE Rule: 401 ("Unauthorized") must be used when there is a problem with the client’s credentials - 31
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 22:28]
    A _401_ error response indicates that
    the client tried to operate on a protected resource _WITHOUT providing the PROPER authorization._
    It may have provided
    + the wrong credentials
      or
    + none at all. 

*** DONE Rule: 403 ("Forbidden") should be used to forbid access regardless of authorization state - 31
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 22:30]
    REST APIs use _403_ to enforce application-level permissions.
    The client does everything right, but for some reason, it can't access some
    resources. For example, out of a specific permitted scope.

*** DONE Rule: 404 ("Not Found") must be used when a client's URI cannot be mapped to a resource - 31
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 22:30]

*** DONE Rule: 500 ("Internal Server Error") should be used to indicate API mal-function - 32
    CLOSED: [2018-11-09 Fri 22:32]
    _500_ is the *GENERIC* REST API _error response_.

    - Most web frameworks automatically respond with this response status code
      whenever they execute some request handler code that raises an exception.

    - A 500 error is *never* the client's fault
      and therefore
      it is reasonable for the client to retry the _exact same request_ that
      triggered this response, and _HOPE_ TO GET A DIFFERENT RESPONSE.
