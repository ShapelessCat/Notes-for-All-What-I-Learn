* Preface
  In the Scala ecosystem, there is *a large number* of /REST frameworks/ and
  each one of them allows you to create such services in a slightly different
  manner.

  This book gives you *an overview* of five of the most mature and flexible REST
  frameworks available, and shows you, through extensive examples, how you can
  use the various features of these frameworks.
