    - Instead (of the traditional way),
      I wanted to teach a course using an easy-to-understand architecture that
      incorporated modern principles and could itself be useful for students.
      * Since every computer that runs a Web browser incorporates a copy of the
        JVM as software, almost every machine today already has a compatible JVM
        available to it.

    - This book, then,
      * covers the central aspects of computer organization and architecture:
        1. digital logic and systems,
        2. data representation,
        3. machine organization/architecture.

      * also describes
        + the assembly-level language of one particular architecture, the JVM,
          
          WITH

        + other common architectures such as
          - the Intel Pentium 4 and the PowerPC given as supporting examples
            _BUT not as the object of focus._
            
    - The book is designed specifically for a standard second-year course on the
      architecture and organization of computers, as recommended by the IEEE
      Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery. =footnote 1=

    - The book consists of _TWO_ parts:
      1. The first half (chapters 1–5) covers
         1) general principles of computer organization and architecture and the
            art/science of programming in assembly language, using the JVM as an
            illustrative example of those principles in action:
            * How are numbers represented in a digital computer?
            * What does the /loader/ do?
            * What is involved in _format conversion_?,
            
            as well as

         2) the necessary specifics of JVM assembly language programming,
            including a detailed discussion of opcodes:
            1. What exactly does _the ~i2c~ opcode_ do,
            2. how does it change the /stack/?
            3. What's the command to run the assembler?.

      2. The second half of the book (chapters 6–10) focuses on
         specific architectural details for a variety of different CPUs,
         including the
         * Pentium, its archaic and historic cousin the 8088,
         * the Power architecture, and
         * the Atmel AVR as an example of a typical embedded systems controller chip.

     - Q :: How many positions are there on the JVM stack?

     - A :: _In theory_, because theJVMis not hardwarelimited, there are as many
            as you need.
            _In practice_, every program, method, or function that you write will
            define a maximum stack size.

     - Similarly, there are no hardware-defined limitations on the amount of memory
       needed. Instead, every method defines a maximum number of local
       variables, not stored on the stack, that can be used to store values
       temporarily.

**** TODO 2.3.2 A Sample Arithmetic Instruction Set - 50
***** Data Types - 50
      - Access a single bit is much less efficient than acessing a word.
        Therefore, in the basic data types of JVM, there is no boolean.

      - In JVM, /boolean/ values are simply represented as the word-sized values
        0 or 1, or in other words as integers.

      - Actually, all the sub-word storage types /byte/, /short/, and /char/ are
        also somewhat _second-class types_.
        + *Reason*: in the JVM doing math on a 32-bit quantity takes no more time
          than doing math on smaller quantities, variables of this type are
          automatically promoted to 32-bit integers inside the CPU.

      - As mentioned above that for calculation, no need to distinguish /sub-word
        types/ from word-size quantities.
          However, *load and storage are differnt* -- _we need to save storage_!
        For this reason, the JVM supports the operations of loading small types
        (byte, short, char, and even boolean) from memory and storing them into
        memory, _particularly FROM and INTO /arrays/._
