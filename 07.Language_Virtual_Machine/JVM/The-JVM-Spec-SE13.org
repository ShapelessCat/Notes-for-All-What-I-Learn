* TODO 2 The Structure of the Java Virtual Machine - 5
** DONE 2.1 The =class= File Format - 5
   CLOSED: [2019-12-04 Wed 16:00]
   - Compiled code to be executed by the JVM is represented using a _hardware- and
     operating system-independent binary format_, typically (but *not necessarily*)
     stored in a file, known as the /class file format/.

   - The /class file format/ PRECISELY defines
     + *the representation of a /class/ or /interface/,*

     + including details such as
       * *byte ordering* that might be taken for granted in a platform-specific
         object file format.

       * ETC. TODO ??? =from Jian= not mentioned in this spec. I want to know more!!!

   - TODO Chapter 4, "The class File Format", covers the class file format in detail.

** DONE 2.2 Data Types - 6
   CLOSED: [2018-03-08 Thu 15:10]
   - Two kinds of types:
     + primitive types
     + reference types

   - Correspondingly, two kinds values
     + primitive values
     + reference values

   - The JVM expects that *nearly all* type checking is _done prior to run time_,
     typically by a compiler, and does not have to be done by the JVM itself.

   - object :: either a dynamically allocated /class instance/ or an /array/.

** TODO 2.3 Primitive Types and Values - 6
   TODO
   TODO
   TODO

*** DONE 2.3.1 Integral Types and Values - 7
    CLOSED: [2019-12-04 Wed 16:57]
    The values of the /integral types/ of the JVM are:
    - ~byte~: [-2^{7}, 2^{7} - 1]
    - ~short~: [-2^{15}, 2^{15} - 1]
    - ~int~: [-2^{31}, 2^{31} - 1]
    - ~long~: [-2^{63}, 2^{63} - 1]
    - ~char~: [0, 2^{16} - 1]

*** TODO 2.3.2 Floating-Point Types, Value Sets, and Values - 8
*** DONE 2.3.3 The ~returnAddress~ Type and Values - 10
    CLOSED: [2019-12-04 Wed 16:05]
    - The ~returnAddress~ type is used by the JVM's ~jsr~, ~ret~, and ~jsr_w~
      instructions TODO (§jsr, §ret, §jsr_w).

    - The values of the ~returnAddress~ type are _POINTERS to the opcodes of /JVM
      instructions/._

    - _UNLIKE_ the /numeric primitive types/, the ~returnAddress~ type
      + does *NOT correspond to any* Java programming language type
        and
      + CANNOT be modified by the running program.

*** DONE 2.3.4 The ~boolean~ Type - 10
    CLOSED: [2019-12-04 Wed 16:52]
    - JVM defines a ~boolean~ type.

    - JVM only provides very limited (=from Jian= direct) support for ~boolean~.
      + Expressions in JPL that operate on ~boolean~ values are compiled to use values
        of the JVM ~int~ data type.

      + JVM does directly support /boolean arrays/.
        * Use ~newarray~ to create it.

        * Access and modify /boolean arrays/ with the /byte array/ instructions
          ~baload~ and ~bastore~.

    - Comments:
      In Oracle's JVM implementation,
      /boolean arrays/ in JPL are encoded as JVM /byte arrays/, using _8 bits per
      boolean element_.

    - The JVM encodes /boolean array/ components using
      + ~1~ to represent ~true~
      + ~0~ to represent ~false~

    - JPL ~boolean~ values are mapped by compilers to values of JVM type ~int~,
      *the compilers MUST use the same encoding.*

** DONE 2.4 Reference Types and Values - 11
   CLOSED: [2019-12-04 Wed 18:00]
   - There are _THREE_ kinds of /reference types/:
     + class types
     + array types
     + interface types

   - Their values are /references/ to _DYNAMICALLY_ created
     + class instances
     + arrays,
     + class instances or arrays that implement interfaces TODO ??? TODO

   - TODO Array type related TODO
     + component type :: ???

     + element type :: a type, not an array type, of the element of an array

     + The element type of an array type is necessarily either a primitive type,
       or a class type, or an interface type.

   - A ~reference~ value may also be the special /null reference/, _a reference to
     no object_, which will be denoted here by ~null~.

   - The /null reference/
     + initially has _NO run-time type_,
     + BUT may be cast to any type.

   - The default value of a ~reference~ type is ~null~.

   - This SPEC does _NOT_ mandate a concrete value encoding ~null~.

** DONE 2.5 Run-Time Data Areas - 11
   CLOSED: [2019-12-02 Mon 19:07]
   There are _TWO_ types of runtime data areas:
   - Be created on when JVM start-up and destroyed only when the JVM exits.
   - Be created when a thread (it belongs to) is created and destroyed when this thread exits.

*** DONE 2.5.1 The ~pc~ Register - 12
    CLOSED: [2019-12-02 Mon 17:29]
    - ~pc~ :: program counter

    - Each JVM thread has its own ~pc~ register.

    - The ~pc~ register contains
      + (non-~native~ method)
        the address of the JVM instruction currently being executed.

      + (~native~ method)
        undefined value

    - The JVM's ~pc~ register is _wide enougth_ to hold
      + a ~returnAddress~;
        OR
      + a /native pointer/ on the specific platform.

*** DONE 2.5.2 Java Virtual Machine Stacks - 12
    CLOSED: [2019-12-02 Mon 18:00]
    Each /JVM thread/ has a *private JVM stack*, created at the SAME TIME as the
    /thread/.

    - A /JVM stack/ stores /frames/ (2.6).

    - The /JVM stack/ is _NEVER manipulated directly EXCEPT to push and pop /frames/,_
      /frames/ may be (???) heap allocated.

    - The memory for a /JVM stack/ does NOT need to be contiguous.
      + In the 1st edition of JVM Spec, the /JVM stack/ was known as _Java stack_.

    - /JVM stacks/
      + EITHER
        to be a fixed size (even fixed size stack JVM, each stack may be chosen
        independenlty when stack is created)

      + OR
        to dynamically expand and contract as required by the computation.

    - The JVM implementation may provide the programmer or the user control over
      + the initial size of /JVM stacks/
      + maximum and minimum sizes

    - The following exceptional conditions are associated with /JVM stacks/:
      + ~StackOverflowError~ =RE-READ=
      + ~OutOfMemoryError~ =RE-READ=

*** DONE 2.5.3 Heap - 13
    CLOSED: [2019-12-02 Mon 18:17]
    /Heap/ is shared among all /JVM threads/.

    - The /heap/ is the _runtime data area_ from which memory for ALL _class
      instances_ and _arrays_ is allocated.

    - The /heap/ is ceated on VM start-up.

    - There is a /automatic storage manangement system/ (known as a /garbage
      collector/). NO particular type of automatic storage management system is
      required. It depends on the implementor's system requirements.

    - The /heap/
      + may be FIXED SIZE
        OR
      + may be EXPANDED as required by the computation
        and
        may be CONTRACTED if a larger heap becomes unnecessary.

    - The memory for the /heap/ does NOT need to be contiguous.

    - Initial size and maximum/minimum heap size can be controled.

    - The following _exceptional condition_ is associated with the /heap/:
      + ~OutOfMemoryError~ =Re-read=

*** DONE 2.5.4 Method Area - 13
    CLOSED: [2019-12-02 Mon 18:58]
    The JVM has a /method area/ that is *shared among all /JVM threads/.*

    - The /method area/ is analogous to ??? TODO TODO TODO

    - The /method area/ stores *per-class* structures such as
      + the /RUNTIME/ /constant pool/, /field/ and /method data/,

      + the *code* for /methods/ and /constructors/,
        including the _special_ /methods/ used in /class/ and /interface/
        initialization and in instance initialization (2.9) TODO

    - Creation time: JVM start-up

    - The /method area/ is _logically_ part of the /heap/,
      simple implementations may choose *NOT* to either gc or compact it.

    - This SPEC does *NOT mandate* the location of the /method area/ or the policies
      used to manage compiled code.

    - The /method area/ may be of
      + a _fixed size_
      + _expanded_ and _contracted_

    - Initial size and maximum/minimum size can be controled.

    - The /memory/ for the /method area/ does _NOT need to be contiguous_.

    - The following _exceptional condition_ is associated with the /method area/:
      + ~OutOfMemoryError~ =Re-Read=

*** TODO 2.5.5 Run-Time Constant Pool - 14 - =RE-READ=
    A /run-time constant pool/ is a *per-class* or *per-interface* run-time
    representation of the ~constant_pool~ table in a ~class~ file (§4.4).

    - It contains several kinds of constants, ranging from numeric literals known
      at compile-time to method and field references that must be resolved at
      run-time. The run-time constant pool serves a function similar to that of
      a symbol table for a conventional programming language, although it
      contains a wider range of data than a typical symbol table.
      TODO TODO TODO TODO NOTE

    - Each run-time constant pool is allocated from the Java Virtual Machine's
      method area (§2.5.4). The run-time constant pool for a class or interface
      is constructed when the class or interface is created (§5.3) by the Java
      Virtual Machine.
      TODO TODO TODO TODO NOTE

    - The following _exceptional condition_ is associated with the construction of
      the /runtime constant pool/ for a /class/ or /interface/:
      + ~OutOfMemoryError~ =RE-READ=

    - TODO
      See _Chapter 5 Loading, Linking, and Initializing_ for info about the CONSTRUCTION
      of the /runtime constant pool/.

*** TODO 2.5.6 Native Method Stacks - 14 - =RE-READ=

** 2.6 Frames - 15
   A /frame/ is used to _STORE data and PARTIAL results_, as well as to _PERFORM
   dynamic linking_, _RETURN values for methods_, and _DISPATCH exceptions._
   TODO TODO TODO ??? ??? ???

   - A new frame is created each time a method is invoked.

   - A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes (normal or abrupt).

   - Frames are allocated from _the /JVM stack/ (§2.5.2) of the /thread/ creating
     the /frame/._

   - Each /frame/ has its *own*
     + array of local variables (§2.6.1),

     + operand stack (§2.6.2),

     + a reference to the runtime constant pool (§2.5.5) of the class of the current
       method.

   - Comments: ???

   - The sizes of the /local variable array/ and the /operand stack/ are *determined
     at compile-time* and are *supplied along with the code for the /method/ associated
     with the /frame/ (§4.7.3).*
     + Thus the size of the /frame data structure/ depends _ONLY_ on
       * the implementation of the JVM
         AND
       * the memory for these structures can be allocated simultaneously on /method
         invocation/.

   - *Only one* /frame/, the /frame/ for the /executing method/, is *active* at any
     point in a _given thread_ of control.
       This /frame/ is referred to as the /CURRENT frame/, and its /method/ is known
     as the /CURRENT method/.

     The class in which the current method is defined is the current class.
     Operations on local variables and the operand stack are typically with
     reference to the current frame.

   - When does a /frame/ cease to be /current frame/?
     + When the /current method/ invokes ANOTHER /method/ --
       this invoked method _will become NEW /current method/._
       * Control transfer: this -> the invoked

     + When the /current method/ completes -- the /method/ who invoked it will
       become NEW /current method/.
       * Control transfer: this -> the invoker

   - A /frame/ is _local_ to its CREATER /thread/, and it _cannot_ be referenced
     by any OTHER /thread/.

*** 2.6.1 Local Variables - 16
    - TODO NOTE

    - A single local variable can hold a value of type
      + boolean
      + byte
      + char
      + short
      + int
      + float

    - A pair of local variables can hold a value of type
      + long

*** 2.6.4 Normal Method Invocation Completion - 18
*** DONE 2.6.5 Abrupt Method Invocation Completion - 18
    CLOSED: [2019-12-04 Wed 18:11]
    - Two reasons of method invocations _complete abruptly_:
      + if execution of a JVM instruction within the method causes the JVM to
        throw an exception (§2.10), and that exception is not handled within the
        method.

      + if the exception due to the execution of an ~athrow~ instruction is not
        caught by the _CURRENT method_.

    - A /method invocation/ that _completes abruptly_ *NEVER* returns a value to
      its invoker.

** DONE 2.7 Representation of Objects - 19
   CLOSED: [2019-12-04 Wed 12:02]
   The JVM does *NOT mandate ANY particular internal structure* for /objects/.

   - Comments:
     In some of Oracle's implementations of the JVM, a reference to a /class instance/
     is a pointer to a /handle/ (TODO concept ???) that is itself _a PAIR of pointers_:
     + to a _table_ containing
       * the _methods_ of the object
       * a _pointer_ to the ~Class~ object that represents the type of the object

     + to the _memory_ allocated from the /heap/ for the object data.

** TODO 2.10 Exceptions - 23
   An /exception/ in the JVM is represented by an /instance/ of the /class/
   ~Throwable~ or one of its /subclasses/.

   - Throwing an /exception/ results in an _IMMEDIATE nonlocal transfer of control
     from the point where the exception was thrown_.

   - /Exceptions/ thrown by the JVM are precise:
     + when the transfer of control takes place, all effects of the instructions
       executed before the point from which the exception is thrown must appear
       to have taken place.

     + BEFORE:
       all effects of the instructions executed before @INSTANCE must appear
       to have taken place.

     + INSTANCE: the exception is thrown and need transfer of control takes place

     + AFTER:
       No instructions that occur after @INSTANCE may appear to have been evaluated.
       =IMPORTANT=
       If optimized code has speculatively executed some of the instructions
       which follow the point at which the exception occurs, such code must be
       prepared to hide this speculative execution from the user-visible state
       of the program.

   - TODO TODO TODO NOTE =RE-READ=

** 2.11 Instruction Set Summary - 26
   - A /JVM instruction/ consists of
     + a *one-byte opcode* specifying the operation to be performed

     + followed by *zero or more operands* supplying *arguments or data* that are
       used by the operation.

   - *MANY* instructions have *no operands* and consist ONLY of an opcode.

   - Ignoring exceptions,
     the inner loop of a Java Virtual Machine interpreter is effectively
     #+begin_src text
       do {
          atomically calculate pc and fetch opcode at pc;
          if (operands) fetch operands;
          execute the action for the opcode;
       } while (there is more to do);
     #+end_src

   - The *number* and *size* of the /operands/ are _DETERMINED BY_ the /opcode/.

   - =IMPORTANT=
     _If_ an /operand/ is *more than one byte in size*,
     _then_ it is stored in *big-endian order* - high-order byte first.
     + Example:
         An unsigned 16-bit index into the local variables is stored as _two unsigned
       bytes_, =byte1= and =byte2=, such that its value is ~(byte1 << 8) | byte2~.

   - The bytecode instruction stream is only single-byte aligned. The two exceptions
     are the lookupswitch and tableswitch instructions (§lookupswitch,
     §tableswitch), which are padded to force internal alignment of some of
     their operands on 4-byte boundaries.
     TODO TODO TODO NOTE ???
     + The decision to limit the Java Virtual Machine opcode to a byte and to forgo data alignment
       within compiled code reflects a conscious bias in favor of compactness, possibly at the cost
       of some performance in naive implementations. A one-byte opcode also limits the size of
       the instruction set. Not assuming data alignment means that immediate data larger than a
       byte must be constructed from bytes at run time on many machines.

   CLOSED: [2017-10-16 Mon 10:56]
   - The description here always satisfy the static and structural constraints of
     $4 (the class file format).

   - If some constraint (a "must" or "must not") in an instruction description is
     _NOT satisfied_ at run time, the behavior of the Java Virtual Machine is
     _undefined_.

     + 255 (0xFF) - ~impdep2~
     + 202 (0xCA) - ~breakpoint~

   - These three reserved opcodes CANNOT appear in valid =.class= files.

   - Tools such as debuggers or JIT code generators ($2.13) may encounter these
     opcodes.

     =From Jian= I think these opcodes are inserted by the code already loaded

    - Operation    Load ~reference~ from array

    - Format       ~aaload~
                   ~index~

    - Forms        ~aload = 25 (0x19)~

    - Operand      ... →

    - Stack        ..., objectref

    - Description  The /index/ is an unsigned byte that must be an index into the local
                   variable array of the current frame ($2.6). The local variable at
                   /index/ must contain a /reference/. The /objectref/ in the local variable
                   at /index/ is pushed onto the operand stack.

    - Notes        The /aload/ instruction cannot be used to load a value of type
                   ~returnAddress~ from a local variable onto the operand stack. This
                   asymmetry with the /astore/ instruction ($astore) is intentional.

                   The /aload/ opcode can be used in conjunction with the /wide/
                   instruction ($wide) to access a local variable using a two-byte
                   unsigned index.
