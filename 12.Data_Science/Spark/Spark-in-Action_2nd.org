* TODO PART 1 THE THEORY CRIPPLED BY AWESOME EXAMPLES - 1
** 1 So, what is Spark, anyway? - 3
*** 1.1 The big picture: What Spark is and what it does - 4
**** What is Spark? - 4
**** The four pillars of mana - 6
     
*** 1.2 How can you use Spark? - 8
**** Spark in a data processing/engineering scenario - 8
**** Spark in a data science scenario - 9
    
*** 1.3 What can you do with Spark? - 10
**** Spark predicts restaurant quality at NC eateries - 11
**** Spark allows fast data transfer for Lumeris - 11
**** Spark analyzes equipment logs for CERN - 12
**** Other use cases - 12
     
*** 1.4 Why you will love the dataframe - 12
**** The dataframe from a Java perspective - 13
**** The dataframe from an RDBMS perspective - 13
**** A graphical representation of the dataframe - 14

*** 1.5 Your first example - 14
**** Recommended software - 15
**** Downloading the code - 15
**** Running your first application - 15

** 2 Architecture and flow - 19
   - This chapter covers
     * Building a _mental model_ of Spark for a typical use case
     * Understanding the associated Java code
     * Exploring the _general architecture_ of a Spark application
     * Understanding _the flow of data_

   - The _mental model_ will describe
     a typical scenario involving _loading_, _processing_, and _saving data_.

   - The scenario you will follow involves
     1. distributed loading of a CSV file,

     2. performing a small operation, and

     3. saving the result in a PostgreSQL database (and Apache Derby).

   - Knowing or installing PostgreSQL is not required to understand the example.
     If you are familiar with using other RDBMSs and Java, you will easily adapt
     to this example.
     * Appendix F provides additional help with /relational databases/ (tips,
       installation, links, and more).
