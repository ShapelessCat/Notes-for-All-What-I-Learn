    + What is Spark SQL?
    + Introducing SparkSession
    + Understanding Spark SQL concepts
      * Understanding RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets
      * Understanding the Catalyst optimizer
      * Understanding Project Tungsten
    + Using Spark SQL in continuous applications
    + Understanding Structured Streaming internals

** What is Spark SQL?
** Introducing SparkSession
   - In Spark 2.0, ~SparkSession~ represents a *unified entry point* for manipulating
     data in Spark.

   - ~SparkSession~ _minimizes_ the number of different /contexts/ a developer
     has to use while working with Spark.
       SparkSession _replaces_ multiple /context/ objects, such as the
     ~SparkContext~, ~SQLContext~, and ~HiveContext~. These contexts are now
     encapsulated within the ~SparkSession~ object.

     =from Jian=
     This means you should use ~SparkSession~ rather than the /contexts/ already
     encapsulated with in it.
