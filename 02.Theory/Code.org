- /Codes/ are often susceptible to /errors/:
  * An error that occurs as a code is _WRITTEN_ (for example, when a student of
    Braille marks dots in paper) is called an *encoding error*.

  * An error made _READING_ the code is called a *decoding error*.

  * In addition, there can also be *transmission errors* -- for example, when a
    page containing Braille is damaged in some way.
