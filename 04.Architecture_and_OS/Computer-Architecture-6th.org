     + from advances in the technology used to build computers
     + from innovations in computer design.

    - When Flynn (1966) studied the /parallel computing/ efforts in the 1960s, he
      found a simple *classification* whose abbreviations we still use today.

      They target /data-level parallelism/ and /task-level parallelism/. He looked
      at the parallelism in the /instruction/ and /data streams/ called for by the
      instructions at the most constrained component of the multiprocessor and
      _placed all computers in one of *four* categories_:
      1. SISD

      2. SIMD

      3. MISD

      4. MIMD

      This taxonomy is a _COARSE_ model, as many parallel processors are *hybrids*
      of the /SISD/, /SIMD/, and /MIMD/ classes.
        Nonetheless, it is useful to put a framework on the design space for the
      computers we will see in this book. =TODO=
